            "the rise and dominance of markets for land, labour, and capital
            are self-undermining, as... feedback mechanisms results in welfare
            declining again and markets losing their quality in facilitating
            successful and rapid exchange, with a relative or even absolute
            downfall of the market economy in question." (pg. 2)
