                The first part of this book deals with microservices. In it,
                Kocher argues that for organizations with large, monolithic 
                applications, adopting a microservice approach could prove
                beneficial because:
            </p>

            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    They are simpler to understand than a monolithic application.
                </li>

                <li>
                    They are easier to scale: only the part of the overall
                    application that is the bottleneck needs to be 
                    given more resources.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It is easier to do continuous delivery when it is
                    microservices being updated, rather than an entire
                    monolithic application.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Looser coupling between components of the system.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Faults are isolated in a microservices and can't bring
                    down all components of a system.
                </li>

                <li>
                    They enable more freedom of choice among technologies,
                    as each microservice team can choose different languages,
                    libraries, databases, and so on.
                </li>


            </ul>

            <p>
                The connection between part one of the book, and part two,
                dealing with containers, and in particular Docker, is loose,
                and consists in little more than Kocher's assertion that 
                containers are a good way to run multiple microservices.
                Alternatives, like "serverless" computing in the cloud,
                are not examined.
            </p>

            <p>
                The editors of this book let the author down in many places,
                leaving in such clunkers as "becomes little complex" and "What
                would happen if the service... has error?"
                A more serious problem is that several contentions don't seem
                to make sense. For instance, the author writes, "Docker...
                addresses the deployment and scalability problems by separating
                applications from the info structure dependencies. It addresses
                these problems with containers, which allow us to package the
                application with all its dependencies." So Docker "separates"
                applications and their infrastructure dependencies by...
                packaging them together?
            
            </p>

            <p>
                Another annoying aspect of this book is the use of extensive
                screen dumps to pad out the material. For instance, the chapter
                on Docker commands is about half images of the output of Docker
                commands. A little of this OK, but a little goes a long way, and
                the extensive use of these images here has gone way too far.
