                This book needed better editing, to avoid sentences like,
                "The pip installer does not check for such conflicts checks
                only if the proposed package already has its dependencies
                installed and will install them if not or remove existing
                incompatible modules" (3) or "Visual Studio Community
                Edition...  usually has enough to compile many C-codes" (3).
