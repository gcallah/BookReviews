            <p>
            This book is a nice introduction to unit test automation in Python,
            albeit one with several annoying flaws. If one needs a succint
            overview of this topic, this book will certainly do the job,
            even though it might have done the job a bit better.
            </p>

            <p>
            The first thing that struck me about this book is that Chapter One
            seems very strange inclusion. It is a very brief, high-level
            introduction to the Python programming language, aimed at someone
            who knows almost nothing about it. But...
            </p>

            <p>
            Is that reader likely to buy a book called <i>Python Unit Test
            Automation</i> as their first introduction to the language?! Won't they
            pick up something with a name like <i>Beginning Python</i>
            or <i>Learn Python in 30 Days</i>? It is hard to avoid
            the suspicion that Pajankar's book had come up
            just a little shy of its minimum page count, and so the
            publisher said, "Why not throw in an intro to Python to start
            things off?"
            </p>

            <p>
            This book includes a very large number of screen shots and copies
            of the output of running some command or other. Now certainly, a
            bit of this can be useful. But truly great programming books, such
            as Software Tools, Programming on Purpose, or Programming Pearls,
            include (almost?) nothing of this sort. It is as though the authors
            had plenty to convey without dumping the screen output of every
            command or program discussed into their works.
            </p>

            <p>
            Again, I don't claim that any inclusion of such output should be
            forbidden. But I suggest that, say, for a series of very similar
            tests, it is enough to put in, "Here is an example of the output of
            test A," and not also show the nearly identical output for tests B,
            C, D and E. And, once again, I have the sneaking suspicion the
            publisher who asks for the output of B, C, D and E is trying to pad
            out a volume they fear may otherwise be too slim to sell.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are also some less serious technical problems in this work.
            For instance, Pajankar claims "You must use [the verbose more of
            doctest] because without it, the test will not produce any output
            unless it fails" (25). However, in many case, that outcome might be
            exactly what one wants: produce output only on failure. In fact,
            that is the default behavior of many UNIX-style tools, and
            Pajankar's recommendation violates Eric Raymond's "Rule of Silence"
            (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Unix_Programming).
            </p>

            <p>
            In discussing Python's built-in unittest module, Pajankar first
            introduces the case of having a single test class in a
            test module, and then presents a case of having several test
            classes in a single module. However, he does not make clear
            <i>why</i> one would want to have one or more than one class
            in a module.
