            <p>
                American conservatives may be cheered by the appearance of a
                book entitled "Why Liberalism Failed." But be forewarned: in
                the sense in which Deneen is using "liberalism," most American
                conservatives are actually liberals
            </p>

            <p>
            "In contrast to its crueler competitor ideologies, liberalism is
            more insidious: as an ideology, it pretends
            to neutrality, claiming
            no preference and denying any intention of
            shaping the souls under
            its rule. It ingratiates by invitation to the easy liberties,
            diversions, and attractions of freedom, pleasure, and wealth."
            -- Patrick Deneen, Why Liberalism Failed, p. 5
            </p>

            <p>
            "The the insistent demand that we choose between protection of
            individual liberty and expansion of state activity masks the true
            relation between the state and market: that they grow constantly
            and necessarily together... Modern liberalism proceeds by making us
            both more individualist and more statist." -- Patrick Deneen, Why
            Liberalism Failed, p. 17
            </p>

            <p>
            "Liberalism has drawn down on a preliberal
            inheritance and resources that at
            once sustained liberalism but which he cannot replenish" (29-30).
            </p>

            <p>
            It is no sort of comeback to Deneen's view to
            point to the great material wealth
            produced by liberalism, since Patrick is quite
            aware of this wealth himself,
            and repeatedly acknowledges its existence.
            But in his view (and mine too)
            liberalism is analogous to the guy at the
            gym that has been popping steroids
            like mad for 10 years, who, when it is
            pointed out that he is getting himself
            into deep trouble, replies, "What?!
            Don't you see all the weight I can lift?"
            Why, yes we do, and it is the very thing
            that has raised your bench press
            poundage into the stratosphere that has gotten you into this fix.
            </p>

            <p>
            This is not to say we might not be wrong,
            just that it is foolish to point to
            the very thing we think has gotten liberal
            societies into such deep trouble
            (the all-out focus on the material) as
            a knockdown riposte to our critique.

"[For Hobbes] the state is charged with maintaining social stability and
preventing a return to natural anarchy... Human beings are thus, by nature,
nonrelational creatures, separate and autonomous." -- Patrick Deneed, Why
Liberalism Failed, 32
            </p>

            <p>
Proto-liberals like Locke and Jefferson and modern liberals like Mises and
Rawls all start from a similar place: we are first and foremost human atoms,
who only need enter into social groups in so far as it suits our interest to do
so. Our original state was as free individuals, who "contracted" into social
groups because we saw it was to our advantage. As Deneen notes, "Even marriage,
Locke holds, is finally to be understood as a contract whose conditions are
temporary and subject to revision..." (33).
            </p>

            <p>
Or, as Mises put it:
            </p>

            <p>
"The fundamental social phenomenon is the division of labor and its counterpart
human cooperation. 
            </p>

            <p>
"Experience teaches man that cooperative action is more efficient and
productive than isolated action of self-sufficient individuals. The natural
conditions determining man's life and effort are such that the division of
labor increases output per unit of labor expended." -- Human Action
            </p>

            <p>
"The fundamental facts that brought about cooperation, society, and
civilization and transformed the animal man into a human being are the facts
that work performed under the division of labor is more productive than
isolated work and that man's reason is capable of recognizing this truth." --
Human Action
            </p>

            <p>
"Every living being is naturally the implacable enemy of every other living
being, especially of all other members of his own species. For the means of
subsistence are scarce. They do not permit all specimens to survive and to
consummate their existence up to the point at which their inborn vitality is
fully spent. This irreconcilable conflict of essential interests prevails first
of all among the members of the same species..." -- Human Action
            </p>

            <p>
So, per Mises, humans live in social groups only because they tried both the
"isolated action of self-sufficient individuals" and social cooperation, and
found the latter suited their self-interest better. Now, those of a religious
bent should surely object to the idea that human beings care for each other
only to the extent that they calculate that cooperating serves their own
self-interest better than being "implacable enemies."
            </p>

            <p>
But one need not be religious to see that Mises is spouting nonsense: humans
(and proto-humans) lived together in tight-knit social groups long before they
could have been calculating the advantages of the division of labor. There
never were "isolated... self-sufficient individuals" with which they could
compare their "output" as members of a group: isolated humans were dead humans,
not self-sufficent humans. And our chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla relatives
also live in tight-knit social groups, and certainly do not regard the other
members of the group as "implacable enemies." (Take a gander at the group of
"implacable enemies" pictured at the top of this post!) In fact, cooperation is
every bit as much a fact of animal life as is competition.
            </p>

            <p>
And methodological individualism is simply the elevation of this false
anthropology into a required postulate of any social science worthy of the
name.
