                A Political Philosophy of Conservatism: Prudence,
                Moderation and Tradition
            </h3>

                Ferenc Hörcher. 2020. Bloomsbury Publishing: London.

                Hörcher launches his case for conservatism by examining
                ancient and Christian traditions of prudence. His starting
                point is Aristotle's concept of <i>phronesis</i>, which might be
                translated as "practical wisdom." <i>Phronesis</i> is distinct
                from theoretical knowledge, in that the latter is independent
                of particular circumstances, while the former consists
                precisely in how to deal with particularities. In this respect,
                Hörcher sees Aristotle as advancing from the work of his
                teacher, Plato, who did not distinguish between theoretical
                smarts and practical know-how.

                Hörcher makes a very important point in his discussion of
                Aristotle: for the philosopher, what is required for a healthy
                polity "is not convincing people by argument, but rather
                through training and experience" (17). If Aristotle is correct,
                it would certainly explain the interminability of modern
                political and ethical arguments: for a people not trained in
                a practice of virtue, arguments in its favor will likely carry
                little weight. Contemporary philosopher Claes Ryn has
                emphasized this point in his work on the importance of the will
                and the imagination.

                Cicero is understood by Hörcher as offering a conservative
                defense of the importance of attention to tradition in the face
                of the radical changes which the Roman Republic was undergoing
                during his life. However, for Cicero, tradition was not a
                static idol to be worshipped: "tradition... needs to be updated
                to meet the demands of the day" (23). Thus, Cicero can be seen
                as offering an early answer to contemporary critics of
                conservatism, who contend that it is inflexible in responding
                to new circumstances.

                Hörcher's discussion of Machiavelli, Guicciardini and Botero
                focuses on a critical turning point in political thought,
                something noted by Pocock is in magisterial work <i>The
                Machiavellian Moment</i>. Machiavelli seems to divorce
                practically oriented political action altogether from the
                sphere of classical/Christian morality. As Hörcher sees things,
                Guicciardini offers "the proper answer to Machiavelli's
                challenge from within the Christian Aristotelian framework"
                (42).

            <p>
                This book is an excellent addition to the political theory
                literature, as it makes clear that prudence is indeed a
                <i>virtue</i> in political practice, and not an unprincipled
                compromise with a fallen world. In our time of ideological
                extremes, such a demonstration takes on extra importance. A
                minor quibble I have is with the editors: while Hörcher is not
                a native English speaker, the editors at Bloomsbury presumably
                are, and they could have done a better job rendering the
                English more idiomatic. But that is a small flaw in an
                otherwise superb work.
