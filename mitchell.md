In the introduction, Mitchell makes a curious distinction as to whether people
believe the most common future form of government would be "democratic" or
"socialist.‚Äù (p. 1) This ignores the fact that there is almost certainly a
great overlap between the two beliefs. Now perhaps Mitchell holds with Hayek
that in the long run democratic socialism is unstable and will cease to be
either democratic or socialist, and perhaps that view is correct, but this is
an opinion poll, and if people think future governments will be both democratic
and socialist, well, that is what they think.
