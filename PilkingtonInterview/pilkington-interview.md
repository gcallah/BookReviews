# Interview with PP Pilkington


Gene Callahan: So, to start, I think there's a potential confusion for American readers in that, typical American usage,
liberalism signifies someone left of center, right? Now, you're using it in the sense of people have said that,
what you have in America is left liberals and right liberals.
So, perhaps you can talk a little bit about how you're using the word liberalism differently than this American sense,
and what you see this global liberalism is that's collapsing.

Philip Pilkington: Yeah, I'm actually... I'm weirdly sympathetic to the American use of liberal. I know there's kind of
we all grow up with if we kind of go to college or we interact with academic types and so on, and Europeans
and, you know, classical liberals and so on will be very kind of snobby about the fact that America's supposedly
distorted the use of the term liberal by referring to the
mainstream of Democratic Party political culture.

And I think you're absolutely right that the main dividing line in American politics has not been liberal and
conservative per se, it's been left liberal and right liberal. At the same time, I think people are kind of onto
something when they see the end result of liberalism's march in the form of the
progressive liberalism that we see in the Democratic Party today, which has now spread, of course, to all
of Europe, and especially to the Anglo countries, like Ireland, Britain, Australia and Canada.
I think there's actually something to that.

When I speak of liberalism, I'm referring to liberalism in a very broad historic, sense. So, I consider that for 
the beginning of liberalism the main political event to have been the English Civil War.
(Which is a misnomer, it wasn't a civil war, it was a revolution.
The English covered that up because they wanted to promote constitutional continuity. But it's not true. There was
a revolution. It was just like the French Revolution. It worked a little bit
differently: armies fought against each other. But, there was a beheading of a monarch,
the establishment of a dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell, and there was enormous social upheaval, cultural and
social upheaval, the stripping of the churches, the attempt to strip what was left of Anglican
culture out of the churches, because it too much resembled Catholicism to the Puritans.

You could even say that the ideological roots of liberalism go back to the Reformation. Brad S.
Gregory wrote a book about that. I totally agree with what he's saying, but I think the English (so-called) Civil War, ,
was actually the first political movement of
liberalism, and it ended up establishing the first major, modern republic in the
form of the short-lived English republic. The other republics prior to that were minor, Calvin's
Geneva, the Venetian Republic, and so on. I think they were just experimenting with sort of a Greek form of government. But in
terms of modern, liberal republics, I think Cromwell was the first. And then, who comes along and
ideologizes Cromwell, but John Locke, in his Two Treatises on Government?
And interestingly, this was understood at the time. John Locke did not publish the two
treatises under his own name.

He *did* publish his empirical philosophy work under his own name, but he, published the two
treaties as under a separate name, and that's because the restoration had already happened.
And he knew that the Two Treatises on Government would have been considered an argument for aspects of the government
that were put in place under the Cromwellian parliamentary dictatorship.

And what was this all about? Well, I think there's an absolute continuity between those initial liberal advances
and the present day of transgender ideology. I don't see any difference between the ideas: they are
all anti-hierarchical.

The fundamental principle of liberalism, on my reading of it, is that there should not be arbitrary
hierarchies in society at all. And this starts off with questioning the status of the king, and the church, and the
episcopate. These are the easy targets in 17th-century England.

And then these the hierarchies become increasingly questioned as time goes on. So, just to give one
example, again, from the early modern period, in the French Revolution,
the revolutionaries *do* kill the king, like the Puritans. But unlike the Puritans,
the French revolutionairies actually try to replace Christian religion altogether.

They try to impose a cult of reason, and put a prostitute in Notre Dame Cathedral. So you're seeing that over time,
liberalism becomes more radical. The Puritans were happy with a very stripped-down form of Protestant religion, you know, very
individualistic, and no ornamentation, and no hierarchy in the church, and so on. (These are the more radical
non-conformists. I know there are Presbyterians and so on who are different, but that was the direction it was moving in.
And then by the time you get to the French Revolution, Voltaire had already made his attacks on the church,
and then the revolutionaries just want to tear the whole thing down.

Now, just really briefly, we continue to see these questioning of hierarchies proceed all the way up to the present day
when we question gender hierarchies. It seems to be almost the pinnacle of the entire liberal project. The family comes
in for criticism and so on. Whig history, which is history seen through the lens of liberal ideology,
pretends that there's a linear trajectory to this.
There isn't. It tends to to move in kind of fits and starts. So some of the liberal principles in the French Revolution,
for example, that were put into place, for example, metric clocks, strange calendars, these kind of things, attempts to
impose very strange principles of rationality on the population would have later been seen as radical by fairly radical
Whigs in the late 19th century. So there's no... there's no actual straight line with liberalism. It's more like a
an path that's kind of bumpy, and it goes through fits and starts. But I think today
we have actually reached the end of it, and I know that's an enormously controversial claim, because we're talking about
a half-millennia-old political movement.

GC: So you mentioned Locke as a founding figure here. How does Hobbes fit in to your story?

PP: I think Hobbes is a fascinating figure. You have to tie him to the philosophy of Francis Bacon as
well. I think what they're doing is they're reintroducing some sort of materialism.
They're kind of putting aside the medieval tradition altogether, this goes back to these Protestant debates, and to what
extent Protestantism influenced liberalism, which I want to make clear to anyone who's reading that I do not discuss in
the book. I think Brad S. Gregory's book is very good on that.

I don't think Hobbes is a liberal per se, but he's kind of laying the groundwork for the sort of anti-hierarchical thought
that's necessary for liberalism. He's reducing people to homogeneous atoms and so on.

GC: Your main claim in the book is that liberalism is on the verge of collapse. Now, I agree with your diagnosis of
the problems that it's spawning.
But while reading your book, I thought about the history of Rome. Now, of course Rome had 
regime changes, although on the surface, Augustus keeps keeps all the forms of the
Republic, but, in fact, establishes the Principate. But you can see collapse happening by the time of the Gracchi
brothers, around the 120s BC, where they're populists who are both killed, and then there's civil wars, and more
assasinations and whatnot, but in one form or another, this polity limps along until 1453, when Constantinople falls.

So why would we think that liberalism won't kind of lurch from crisis to crisis with some calmer
periods for some indeterminate length of time? Why should we think that collapse is imminent?

PP: I think the collapse here that we're talking about is, in some sense, potential civilizational collapse. It doesn't
have to be, we can pull out of it, I think.
Rome effectively civilizationally collapses, there's no doubt about that, and that... those
kind of things take a long line, as you said. And, you know, some people could even claim that Rome never collapsed, and
that modern Europe is Rome, and I'm sympathetic to some of those arguments. But the issue with liberalism is pretty
different, to my mind, because Rome, for all its faults,
Rome kind of rises and falls like a normal kind of empire. But the
governance structures of Rome, the ideas on which it were founded, were not really the problem.
It was a political problem in Rome. It was over-expansion due to empire.
That's a political issue. We still, if you go to a courtroom in Europe, you're operating under very obvious aspects
of Roman law, and those things continue on even in the Anglo-Saxon
legal tradition. I don't think Rome ever really was discredited, in a sense. Maybe some of the barbaric practices,
pre-Christian practices, were by the emergence of Christianity.
discredited. 
Liberalism's a very different beast, because, I don't think it actually works
as a governing structure. I don't think it *can* work.
I think it's very similar to Marxist communism in that way. Marxist communism, as you know, if you read the book,
I'd consider just a slightly radical offshoot cousin of liberalism. Although, in some senses, as Ryszard Legutko has
pointed out, liberalism is more radical than Marxist communism, in some ways. Not on the economic side, but
in practice anyway, on the attacks on family and the church.
But the issue is that liberalism was never properly tried. It's been around for 500 years,
and over those years, it's been an enormously popular ideology among the bohemian side of the elite.
Increasingly then, in the 20th century, probably around... well, I'd say in the late 19th century, it had already
risen to kind of mainstream in Britain, and then it was obviously mainstream in the American global period after 1945.

But as I say in the book, I distinguish two different things: soft liberalism and hard
liberalism. Soft liberalism is when liberalism mixes with non-liberal aspects of society.
In the West, again, we can refer back to Roman legal structures and Christian moral structures: the
foundations of Western civilization.
And liberalism can kind exist parasitically on top of those more hierarchical structures.

And, as I said, it goes in fits and starts. Occasionally, you get this burst of hard liberalism. For example, I
think the English Civil War was such a burst, and even more profoundly, the French Revolution was. The 1848 revolutions were
bursts of hard liberalism. The Paris Commune was another burst of hard liberalism.
But these were very short-lived, and they tended to provoke an almost immediate reaction, perhaps within
a generation, and you'd get some sort of restoration.
You might get a more liberal regime in Napoleon III or something like that, but it's
intermixed with the regal structures, or the church structures:
the French were particularly good at coming up with these hybrid soft-liberal republics, one after the other.

And the Americans did, too, in a different way. But that's basically what happened. Now, what that
meant was that liberalism never really penetrated deeply into the social fabric at all. For most of the liberal
period, if you want to call those 500 years the liberal period,
most people in the West lived Christian lives. Even if they didn't believe in 1890 in Britain, even if they all just
pretended to believe, they lived in line with Christian morality.
And when they went to a courtroom, they were governed by some form of Roman legal principles, right? And this is
married with Christian ethical principles.

Since about 1990, that has not been the case. This is the period I call hyperliberalism in the book.
What's happened is liberalism has spread quite quickly into the body politic, right
down to all levels. So, just to give an example, if you go back to the early 19th century, early 20th century, I should
say, British elite, okay? You can read loads of novels from that period, Evelyn Waugh, something like that, and you'll see
these people
and you'll say, I know these people. These are liberals. These are the same decadent, bohemian liberals that I see
today.

And they were everywhere in the British elite back then, and there were some in America, too, such as
Mabel Dodge Luhan, and these people, artistic bohemian types, but they were quite powerful, and they'd go on to
influence various things. But they were always in the elite crust, right? And that was often the case with these more
radical liberal thinkers. You might go back to John Stuart Mill and Godwin. But what happened in the 1990s was that
bohemian hyperliberalism was democratized.

And it was sent down right into the groundwater, as it were, of our societies. And I
think by about the time of the second Obama administration, society had succumbed to complete liberalization. Complete.
And we are currently living in the in the debris of that right now.

Liberalism is now how people self-identify. It is how they live their lives. Even the people who don't want
to be liberals, like you and me, we have to live in it; we can't get away from it. That's how society is.
And I don't think that's sustainable.

I don't think that is a possible way to govern a society. So the key question is, "So can we go back to soft
liberalism? Can we go back to Coca-Cola in glass bottles in 1956 California?" No, I don't think so. Because once you
actually try liberal ideology, it discredits itself, just like central planning did in the USSR.

GC: Given these ideas were around, and they were circulating amongst elites who, for the most part,
thought that these ideas should spread, we should liberate the common people too, why in the 90s, in particular,
were they able to actually spread liberalism throughout society, whereas earlier, they hadn't been able to?

PP: It's a really good question. I have not addressed in the book, to be clear. It's a very complex question, and I
think it's one that's been debated, especially in American conservative circles. I think this is the big question in
American conservative circles.
I think I'm not gonna say anything terribly original here. I think a lot of it had to do with the 60s.
I think that this cultural revolution was democratized. It then became commercialized. I think that was really
important. The mass consumer commercial culture wasn't there in the past to catch hold of these ideas and democratize
them and spread them throughout society. But even after the 60s and the weirdo 70s, as I've heard them referred to
sometimes, 1983 America, while a lot more liberal than 1953 America, still wasn't thoroughly liberal.

But the Cold War ended, the greatest generation, who were soft liberals, as I'd call them, died off.
I think the last non-hyper-liberal president was probably George H.W. Bush. And then in comes Clinton:
These were the baby boomers, they'd never experienced war or conflict themselves at least not the elite
ones who dodged the draft in Vietnam and so on. And then they were told, "You run the world now. And there are absolutely
no limits to your power. There are no checks and balances on your power, you don't have to think about that at all."

And then they were handed extremely highly developed mass media systems, propaganda systems.
And I think all of that just came together: the perfect mix. And then they went for it. And when it
reaches its zenith, when it really kicks into high gear in the second Obama administration, we have the new Internet
tools to spread it, which are mass psychological manipulation techniques, really military-grade
psychological warfare operations, that's what we're dealing with.

GC: I saw somebody posted a cartoon where guys at the CIA are talking, and they said, "We've tried for years
to track what every American was up to and where they were every minute of every day... but now, we have Facebook,
and they just tell us."

PP: Exactly!

GC: At one place in the book, you write: "a society that organizes itself in line with human nature will be stable,
prosperous, and its inhabitants will be content and happy."

Now, I think it's a sound idea to organize a society in line with human nature, but that sentiment seems kind of optimistic to
me. Look: Eden was organized in line with human nature, and yet still we fell.
And, you find Plato saying, even if we could establish the very best republic, it would decay over time,
given the nature of the world of becoming.

And then there's the situation of some society maybe going along fine on its own. I don't know what the political
situation in Poland was like in 1939. But let's just posit you have a good society, but..
you have two big, aggressive neighbors, and they just snuff out your polity. So isn't your claim over-optimistic?

PP: Well, I'm definitely not a utopian at all. I think basically in line with classical political philosophy.
But if you can organize it in line with human nature, you probably have the best of all possible worlds, right?
It's not going to last forever, history changes, and it'll probably decay. I definitely buy into a cycle of
regimes argument.

I got some criticism, especially from more Christian thinkers,
that I was relying overly on a kind of Hegelian methodology in the book.
And I accept that, because I think Hegel's a liberal, actually. I just wrote a piece for *Post-Liberal Order*
responding to these critics, saying basically that I agree with their criticisms of Hegel, but what may be of
value in those type of Hegelian process philosophies is that everything is in a state of becoming. There is
no ultimate *telos* in this world. I'm Catholic, so I *do* think there is an ultimate end, just not in this world.

And basically, in trying to establish a decent society, just build in as much natural
law as possible. And the more natural law you build in, the more content people will be.
They won't be perfectly satisfied. People aren't like that. They're
funny, strange creatures, but it's the best you're going to get.

And you can, you know, compare America in 1955 with America in 2025. And you can say that one of them is a better, more
stable society than the other.

And why is that? Because people are more so adhering in 1955 to natural law structures. Family
structures, respect for authority, respect for teachers, that's a big thing in Plato that we forget about today.
I don't think there's a perfect society, and in fact, one of the main
points I've been making in interviews since the book came out
is that we're going to see a multitude of different civilizational societies emerge, from the Chinese to the Russian
to the Indian.

PP: to the neo-Ottoman Turkic, probably, to the neo-Shia Iran. I mean, these are going to be different societies, and
they're going to look very different, but I think what they'll share in common is that they'll be aspiring to something
resembling natural law thinking. And of course, natural law thinking doesn't just exist in the West. I've been over to
China twice this year, talking with Confucian scholars and so on, and there's

PP: I am of the view, the Jesuit view, that there is definitely natural law thinking in, for example, Confucius, which
is pretty much as advanced as our pagan thinkers, just to point out. So, it'll look different elsewhere, and it'll never
be per... it'll... everywhere, and it'll never be perfect, but, you know, that's just the... that's the human condition,
in a sense.

GC: Wow, the fuck?

GC: Right, so we're both, readers of John Gray, and

GC: his recent... You know, I think... well, I think he's been saying this since the 90s. He just came out with a column
in the New Statesman, an essay in The New Statesman, reiterating this. And...

GC: Well, he has many criticisms of liberalism.

GC: He doesn't think that there is... you know, what he sees as the actual, best thing we can do, given our situation,
is a kind of modus vivendi liberalism that

GC: Stops trying to... Invade...

GC: subcultures and liberalize them, right? That allows Muslims to be Muslims, and allows, Mormons to be Mormons, and
the Amish to be Amish, and accepts this diversity.

GC: But, under a general, broadly liberal umbrella. So, you know, I think what he is...

GC: Essentially, in your terms, doing is saying, well, we can return to soft liberalism, and in fact.

GC: There... he would contend there's no consensus

GC: for, for instance, re-Christianizing the U.S, that this would be very divisive, and it's... it's not going to happen
given

GC: the,

GC: the large number of people who would object to the project. So, how would you respond to Gray's contention here?

PP: Well, those... to my mind, they're two separate things. So, having different cultural and religious groups

PP: live, in harmony, I suppose, has nothing to do with liberalism. It's happened before liberalism, it's happened
since. I'm currently sitting in Budapest. I was down in Serbia a few weeks ago.

PP: We are close to the border here. There are minarets with the... with the crescent taken down all over the little
towns here.

PP: And what I'm saying there is that this region occasionally lived in harmony with various religious groups, and it
occasionally lived in conflict with those religion groups, being the Ottoman Turk Muslims, and the various Christian
denominations, from the Orthodox in Serbia to the Catholics and

PP: Lutheran population, and...

PP: in Hungary. Now, these people found a nice solution in the form of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, or previously the
Austrian monarchy.

PP: It was quite a stable situation, and although it is kind of controversial to say, after a few drinks, most people in
the region will admit that the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was a pretty good way of running things. It was not a liberal
entity at all, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. It was Catholic. It was quite Catholic, quite aggressively Catholic, but
tolerant.

PP: tolerant. So I'll just give you an example of that. In Romania, I visited a Kolish forest, they call it here.

PP: And, the town, basically, Kolishvar, which was Hungarian, still is partially Hungarian, went through a phase of...
where a radical preacher came to town, I think it was in the 17th or 18th century, and he converted everyone to
Protestantism.

PP: think Lutheranism, it could have been Calvinism.

PP: And the Habsburgs tolerated it. They, you know, gritted their teeth, and they tolerated it, and they didn't invade.
And then he got new ideas into his head and converted everyone to Unitarianism.

PP: And then they sent in the cavalry. And I think it's a great story. And then most of them are Catholic, but I
actually had the privilege of

PP: visiting a trad Unitarian village, which was full of Hungarians. It's the most fascinating place I've ever been in
my life. But, this is... this is the history around here, and it has nothing to do with liberalism.

PP: And actually, I think that liberalism can often increase tensions between religious groups. I think they're... I
think they're actually selling it in a very duplicitous way. I think, for example, the British liberal empire had a
tendency to play groups off each other, to... to dominate liberal power. America's done a little bit of that as well,
not quite as bad as the British have, but, so I think there's a lot of duplicity.

PP: in that. So, we are going to have to figure out a way of living together, especially in Europe with our large Muslim
populations. I think it's going to be very difficult. I think these ideas that we're going to re-migrate everyone are
crazy. I think they'd lead to civil war. And I don't think that we're going to Christianize a bunch of, strongly
believing Muslims who seem to believe in their faith more than the Christians on the continent. So, that's a,

PP: that's a separate... I think that is one question, one of religious toleration, and we are... I mean, that's just
the world. The world's always just had to come to that conclusion. Before end times, does everybody become a Christian?
That's above my pay grade, I don't know. But then the second question is.

PP: can we re-Christianize the... how should I put it? I don't want to call them former Christians, because they're not
former Christians. The current liberals, you know, progressive liberals, or whatever they are, they're kind of, they are
still in that tradition. They're not Muslim.

PP: They're a civilization of the same as...

PP: actual practicing Christians' civilizational roots. So the question, really, for, I think, us, is what do we do with
our own people, in a sense? I mean, the religious toleration question is very important, but it's a separate question
from what we do with our own people.

PP: And I really don't see any alternative here. I mean, these people are either going to have to find their way back to
some of their civilizational roots, or

PP: they're going... in fact, they already are, revert to barbarism. They are. It's very clear to me that they're going
to revert... they already are reverting to barbarism, and I don't mean that just in an ethical sense, like, how dare
they, you know, support abortion. Obviously, I don't like the fact they support abortion, but, you know, that's like the
90s version of this. No, I mean they will not be able to live properly. Like, they will not be able to take care of
themselves, they will not be able to reproduce.

PP: themselves as a species. They will put enormous burdens on our

PP: social care systems and so on, and we're already seeing this. It's becoming really profound now in my generation,
millennials and younger. I mean, the social norms have completely evaporated, and a lot of these people don't really
know how to live properly, and it's only going to get worse and worse, and eventually you'll come to kind of like a...

PP: I mean, I don't want to be offensive about it, but it really will be kind of...

PP: people... people in bear skins, but in a digital world, you know? And the people in the bear skins aren't going to
be very productive or useful. They're going to be quite chaotic, we're already seeing that around the edges.

PP: And they're not, you know, gonna... and they're gonna require a lot, especially if they don't want to reproduce and
so on. So there... that's the real question to me. I think the...

PP: what the Muslims do with Turkey isn't really our business. Obviously, we have to live with it, and we have to live
in a world with them and everything like that, and we should try and do that in harmony. We don't want conflicts. But
really, our focus shall be on what do we do with the

PP: previous, but they're not really previous, the Christians that have kind of been wrecked by liberalism.

PP: And as I said, I think it's, you know, they had that old phrase in the 60s, socialism or barbarism in France. I
think it is really re-Christianization or barbarism. I don't mean that they all have to go to church or anything like
that, but they have to start adhering to the... to the sorts of, moral values that say,

PP: a slightly agnostic person in America in 1955 adhered to.

GC: Oh, whoa...

GC: Walker Percy in, Love in the Rooms is talking about his, girlfriend at the time, and he said she was,

GC: a really good Christian who didn't believe in God.

GC: And he said, on the other hand, I believe in God, but I'm a very bad Christian.

PP: It's very good, yeah.

PP: We all know people like that.

GC: Yes, alright,

GC: when it comes to the military, this was very interesting. I, of course, had seen the case made that

GC: Liberalism, leads to imperialism that... and, you know, this was clear when,

GC: America was gonna spread democracy throughout the Middle East, and, you know, was gonna produce little mini Americas
all over the world. But what was interesting in your book was that you make a strong case

GC: but one that I'm not really capable of evaluating, that liberalism is making purely,

GC: tactical errors. Not just strategic errors trying to spread liberalism everywhere, but tactical errors in, the way
that liberal societies spend money on military equipment.

GC: So, where did, how did you, develop this thesis? Have you,

GC: did you have military experience in your background? It's just, I hadn't seen this case before, and like I said, I
think you made a strong case for this, but I'm just curious how you arrived at it.

PP: Well, no, I have no military background. I'm an economist. I can claim to be that. I have no military background,
and I am not one of these weapons hobbyist guys that you'll find. I kind of like firearms, but I had no interest. I
couldn't...

PP: 5 years ago, I couldn't have told you what a tank, you know, which tank was which. I was not one of these... I know
people like that, and often they're very knowledgeable, and I wasn't one of those people.

PP: And it was, it was the war. It was the war in Ukraine. I was fascinated by what was going on. I was fascinated the
moment it broke out, because everything that I knew

PP: Was basically that we...

PP: well, I hadn't thought about it. It's one of those times, you know, I... I... there's this great,

PP: a phrase I always go back to, it's by,

PP: Hubert Dreyfus, the Heidegger scholar, and he says, says in one of his lectures that, that anytime you use a door,
you, you never think about it.

PP: But when the doorknob doesn't work, you think about it, and in fact, you can panic. You can go, oh, am I stuck in
the room, you know? And that's really striking. I've had that experience a couple of times. You know, intellectually,
I've had that experience a couple of times in my life, and they're always the most revealing times in your life, in a
sense.

PP: And and that was the Ukraine war, because I realized that my assumption, which I'd never really thought about, was
the assumption of everybody, actually, which was that, basically.

PP: well, NATO, or the United States, or whoever we want to say backed the Ukraine side in that war, was really big,
economically.

PP: And we kind of thought, you know, maybe China's getting a bit of an edge in technology, but certainly Russia's not
getting an edge in terms of technology. Now, that wasn't all true, actually. Russia had, had advanced in missile
development.

PP: and in a few other spheres. But, you know, we thought, well, we're the big economies, and so therefore, you know,
there's absolutely no chance that Russia, if we poured all this materiel into this very large and well-trained army in
Ukraine.

PP: then they'll, you know, if they don't win, they'll, you know, grind it to a real stalemate, like a real one, where,
like, it's just obvious within, like, a year that it's a real stalemate. And the Russians will start taking so many
losses that they can't replace their weapons and so on. That all turned out to be completely false.

PP: And the more I... I just got fascinated with it, I just spent... I was just watching it every day. I read enormous
amounts about military strategy, I... I started reading about how you planned, you know, strike packages, and...

PP: and all this kind of thing, and the conclusion I came to was.

PP: that, the West had just run away with itself. It had become completely, enamored with technology.

PP: And some of this was... well, it was... it was jewel. It was partly because the United States, as the hegemon,
especially since the 1990s, but even in the Cold War, to a certain extent, set its military up like a... like a global
policing operation.

PP: And in a global policing operation, relying on, like, the best optic on your rifle, or whatever, like, makes some
sense.

PP: makes absolutely no sense in mechanized industrial warfare, obviously. And so I realized that was one thing, and
that was... that was inherent in the nature of the unipolar, you know, quasi-imperial system, let's be honest.

PP: But the other sense of it was, number one, a complete fetishization of progressive technology, technological
development, which was... is definitively liberal. It's a real hallmark of liberalism. Right up to the idea that, you
know, the stuff I was reading from, like, the RAND Corporation thought that within 10 years, we'd have robots fighting
robots, and there'd be no...

PP: Human deaths and all this kind of stuff.

PP: Stuff that's just really... Almost to my mind.

PP: And,

PP: And so there was these two things kind of working together, the kind of liberal, progressive view of technology,
which is the liberal aspect of it.

PP: and the slightly more contingent, you know, geopolitical set of circumstances that the United States and its NATO
allies, mainly the United States, found itself in. And then the one thing that I don't write about too much in the book,
I just did... there was no space, because the military chapter is so long already, is the nature of military
procurement.

PP: using a market or quasi-market-based system, as they do in the United States and the West, actually encourages,
through the very high profit margins that they can make, these technologically advanced

PP: products over commodified products, like, you know, just generic tanks, generic drones, and so on. These are more
things that are in what you might say in manufacturing are low margin products. You produce more of them, and you get a
low margin. Nobody really... if you're given the choice, no capitalist really wants a low margin. It's a lot of work.

PP: For a little bit of profit, whereas the high margin ones, it's... it's less work for a lot more profit.

PP: And also, the other issue is the procurement becomes a complete nightmare in that kind of a system, because, like,
you show some big laser weapon, and there's two of them, like, how do you price that?

PP: it's much easier for me to price, say, 1,500 T-72 tanks have rolled off the production lines in Russia. Yeah, I can
look at the inputs, the steel, blah blah blah. I know, basically, what the economics of that are. Then you show me the
laser weapon, and I'm like, I don't know, I don't know who to price that.

PP: So there's a lot of room for graft, in a sense, in that as well. So those kind of things came together. So what I
ended up concluding was, basically, that the Soviet model of quantity over quality is the correct one, unusually, I
suppose.

PP: And that's not that surprising, because centrally planned economies don't work, we know that. But centrally planned
economies work very well for some things.

PP: And for military production, mass military production, yeah, you want a centrally planned economy. To build the
highway system in America, you want that centrally planned, actually.

PP: The early Soviet Union, not to get off on too much of a tangent, but the early Soviet Union, from the Stalinist
collectivist phase in the 1930s up until the 1960s, when the main,

PP: products were infrastructure development, electricity infrastructure, road infrastructure, rail infrastructure,
building housing for people. I'm not talking about the quality here, but up until the 60s, when they had to turn to
consumer products, central planning worked.

PP: And, you know, that was well recognized in America. That's what scared people, and seduced some people, like the
people around Kennedy, John Kenneth Galbraith, and so on. And you still see, I mean, as I said in Budapest, I walk
around and I still see the Soviet-era stuff. It's quite well built.

PP: So, central planning has its place, and central planning is definitely not a liberal principle.

PP: And it seems to me that militaries must be centrally planned, and the liberalization of the military that took place
was always kind of there. It was always kind of there in the Western militaries after World War II, but it really ramped
up in the 1990s.

PP: And it's produced what we see today. Massively expensive weapons that are wiped out by extremely cheap weapons
produced elsewhere, even in Iran.

GC: So, I am a recovering libertarian, and as such, have a number of libertarian friends.

GC: And, they would find this puzzling as a critique

GC: Of their version of liberalism, because they would say, well, of course.

GC: government spending is quite different in private spending. Of course, it's plagued with ineffici, and these, you
know, these public choice problems will arise. So I wonder to what extent... now.

GC: I don't know what they'd offer as an alternative here to the way, the U.S. does procurement, but they wouldn't see

GC: your critique as a critique of liberalism or markets. They would say, well, this is a critique of government
spending, which of course has these problems, and that's why we want to minimize it.

PP: Well, the first thing I'd say is it's a longer discussion, and we won't get into it, but markets are not liberalism,
and liberalism is not markets. Markets have existed before liberalism, and they'll exist after it. Markets, to my mind,
are very natural human relationships, and that's why they're the best at distributing consumer products, certainly.

PP: I'm not sure if they're as good at distributing capital investment, having worked on Wall Street for 10 years, I've
seen some a lot of close.

PP: But they are definitely very good at distributing consumer products, and I think they are... they're just natural
law-based, entities. I think that you can find non-liberal thinkers talking about markets. The Salamanca School stands
out as the most prominent. That's a post-Reformation, counter-Reformation, I should say, Catholic, I think they're
Thomas, so maybe I'm wrong with that. Jesuits or something.

PP: And, so markets are a separate bag to liberalism. I think where liberalism comes into the picture is the
fetishization of markets, is the thinking, and this would be my criticism of the libertarian strain of liberalism.

PP: that markets solve absolutely every problem. And at that point, they kind of become a fetishization, and they
definitely become ideological at that point.

PP: As in, ever, you know, you're there with a hammer and everything looks like a nail. If you're there with a hammer
and everything looks like a nail, you're in the space of ideology, to my mind. Like, you've left the realm of practical
political thinking behind, and you're in the realm of ideology. And there's, you know, varying ideologies, but you're in
the realm of liberal ideology when you're trying to apply market-based principles to absolutely everything.

PP: And that's kind of how I think about it. Markets function very well in certain circumstances. They function somewhat
poorly in others, and they don't function at all.

PP: in others, and that a military is just one that they do not function at all. There is absolutely no way

PP: to... that I can think of, I think I'm a reasonably confident economist. There is no way I can think of to come up
with some market mechanism to put a price on military goods that may never be used.

PP: I mean, that's ultimately what we're dealing with. It could be... let's imagine that you had a three cycles of
military goods, maybe once every 10 years.

PP: You get a new kind of wave of innovations. And you have no war in those 30 years.

PP: how do you price these things? I mean, it's... it's... now, what I am saying is that the pricing of the

PP: 1,500.

PP: tanks is easier, but you price them on an input-output basis, and that's central planning. That's literally how you
do central planning. That's how Gaul's plan used to do central planning in the Soviet Union. And as far as I understand
it, that's effectively how the Russian and Chinese, for that matter, military-industrial complex works at the moment.

PP: So no, it's not a criticism of markets. I'm an economist. I believe markets have a very large role to play in
society, but the fetishization of markets, I think, is very damaging. And in the other direction, where the
fetishization of markets is very damaging.

PP: is where they start to colonize human relationships. We're seeing that at the moment, so I... one of my favorite
examples at the moment is... I said I used to work on Wall Street.

PP: private equity firms are now buying up en masse campgrounds in the United States, and they're, you know,
monopolizing them, and the rent prices are going up, and you can go on Instagram or whatever, all the RV guys are
complaining about it. And there's loads of instances of this, of private equity snapping up various parts of society
that the money power markets

PP: shouldn't be in. And that's really pernicious as well. So, so the fetishization of markets, I think, is really
dangerous in both directions. It can go too deep into the social fabric to extract value. I wrote a piece for American
Affairs recently calling that consumption deepening, as in when you have to kind of go into people's souls to extract
more profit. And then... and then another more practical instance, like in the case of military

PP: planning. So we just shouldn't fetishize markets, and we should try and disconnect them from liberalism. Markets are
a very good way to spread liberal principles. They just work like that. But they're not in... that's not inherent in
them. That's like saying social media is a really good way of spreading liberal principles. It is.

PP: But that doesn't mean social media is inherently liberal. You could create a non-liberal, social media. So I just
don't think we should fetishize markets. I don't think we should fetishize anything.

GC: Yep.

GC: Very good. You talk about,

GC: a large number of technologies developed by the state. Again, here I'm thinking... so I'm playing devil's advocate
and playing libertarian, responding to you here.

GC: If we consider Toyota, 3M, Bellab, Xerox, Park, and we could throw on more examples. There are also lots of... lots
and lots of new technologies developed outside the state.

GC: Famously, you know, the internet started as a DARPA project, but a lot of the technologies enabling the internet
were developed. Bell Labs did a lot of that, right? So a libertarian response there is likely to run... well, yes, given
the

GC: amount of government taxation and spending. Of course, there's a number of technologies that were... happened to be
developed by the government, but if they hadn't been sucking up these resources, think how much more

GC: These private companies would have developed. They developed a lot as it is, and they, without all this taxation,
they would have developed even more.

GC: So how would you respond to a critic like that?

PP: Well, they can't prove it. The thing is, like, the... even if I don't believe that stuff, I... I don't think that
markets solve all the problems, and I think the state does have a role to play in the economy. But even if I didn't
think that.

PP: the state's never gonna go away. This is, like, this is... this is the liberal anti-hierarchical utopianism. Like,
even if you accept all the libertarian principles, if in the best case scenario the state went away and it disappeared
and etc, etc, we'd be in a better society, like... yeah, but it's never gonna go away, because the state is a natural
formation in human relationships.

PP: And so all you're actually going to get is a better or worse state. And you can try and infuse that state with
market principles.

PP: might not work out so well, because it's not a market-based system, and it'll just exercise its kind of fiat and
monopoly power. You might make the situation even worse than in the interventionist state. You know, it's not... even
from a libertarian economics point of view, it's actually pretty hard to think through those kind of problems.

PP: My advice would be do not try and inject too much market principles into the state. I've never really seen it work
very well. But I just don't think the state is going away. I think those arguments are kind of like, you know, you know,
you read Rousseau on the Noble Savage. I think it's of the same ilk. It's like, my response to Rousseau, obviously the
Noble Savage isn't real from an anthropological point of view, but I don't think you even need to say that. I think I
could go back to the 18th

PP: century, I'm pretty sure people did say this to him, and just say, like, there is no such thing as a noble savage,
because, like, there is always a society. The person is always born into that.

PP: And so it's a kind of... it's a kind of moot point. I see the same thing with the state. Now, that... that doesn't
mean that you have to have a large state or a small state.

PP: I mean, just take the example today of the Chinese state versus, say, the British state, right? The British state,
since the Thatcher era, has tried to inject as much in terms of market principles

PP: They call it neoliberal principles, or whatever, into that state. It's tried to have all these public-private
partnerships, all of these things. It brands itself as a kind of a market state, and you could say something similar for
the German state, except the Germans are actually more competent at doing it. The British state's enormous. It's one of
the largest as a share of GDP in the world, not quite as big as the French, but it must be 45%

PP: of British GDP is in the British state. Meanwhile, look at the Chinese state. It's much smaller.

PP: It's only about 30%, I think, of GDP, much lower taxes in China and so on, very noticeable if you go there. But the
Chinese state

PP: is not neoliberal. It says we intervene in the economy really directly. It intervenes in capital formation. It
controls... it controls the banking sector, not just at the Federal Reserve interest rate setting level. It does credit
rationing in the banking sector through the People's Bank of China and so on. It is a real, what they used to call, dear
regime state in the French parlance. And yet, look at that. The Chinese state is substantially

PP: smaller than the British state. And when I ask people in China, like, oh, do you guys want to grow the state? They
go, like, why would we want to grow the state? We'll grow the state if we need more state, but we don't want to grow the
state for the sake of growing the state. Like, they think that question's odd. They think that's an unusual question to
ask.

PP: And yet, if you ask a Fabian socialist.

PP: in the Labour Party, well, do you think we should grow the state? Oh, yes, we should grow the state. It's such an
unusual way of thinking about things.

PP: So I don't think that the... I don't think that the nature of a state has anything to do with the size of a state. I
personally think you're better off with probably about, you know, 30% of GDP as the state. It's pretty much the same in
Hungary, I think it's 35% here. Pretty small state. Again, enormous irony, because most people

PP: Hungary is some autocracy that's ruled over by, you know, some sort of a King Orban or something like that. The
state's much smaller here. The income tax rate is 15%. So, and yet, at the same time, I think that the Hungarian state
bills itself as a more interventionist state than the British state.

PP: In terms of intervening in certain markets. So I don't think the nature of the state is the same as the size of the
state, and I... in response to what would it look like without the state, I think you were... that's noble, savage
thinking, because I think states are inherent in human society.

GC: Let's, finish up, reading your book. I was, occasionally thinking of Renee Girard.

GC: And your recent comments

GC: bring us... bring that thought back to mind. In particular, He discusses,

GC: he does an analysis of Troilus and Cressida, and ulysses gives a speech where he says, now that,

GC: hierarchies are overthrown, basically. I'm quoting from memory, so this isn't word for word, but now, you know,
everything's chaotic. And what Girard shows, I think.

GC: Is that the attempt

GC: to overturn hierarchies does not result in an egalitarian society where everyone is equal. What it results in is a
fierce struggle

GC: for a position.

GC: And, you know, we see that,

GC: Musa Al Garbi analyzes wokeness as a struggle amongst elites to position themselves as the most woke, because this
is prestigious, and if I'm woker than you, then I'm more deserving of an elite position.

GC: Are you familiar with Girard's work, and do you see it connecting to your own?

PP: Yeah, actually, this connection's really interesting, and I haven't said it yet to anybody.

PP: But I kind of have a little bit of a joke, maybe to myself, maybe I've said it to somebody else, that the book... my
account of liberalism is massively inspired by the work of Gilles Deleuze, the French post-structuralist philosopher,
who wrote a book that's...

PP: both kind of brilliant and kind of awful, called Anti-Oedipus.

PP: I wouldn't really recommend reading it. I'm not sure why I read it, but I read it, and I said, this is the best
account of the liberal mechanism I've ever read.

PP: And where does it link up with Girard? Because both of them come from the French structuralist tradition.

PP: They come from the tradition of French structuralist anthropology, basically started... well, started with Marcel
Maus and so on, but really formulated by Levi Strauss, the philosopher. The anthropologist, I should say.

PP: And they think in those... in those exact terms, I think Gerard is often just putting many of these mythological
structures, and I think he's explicit with this because he's an anthropologist, and he's putting them in this
structuralist form.

PP: And, what you... what... what Gilles Deleuz and his co-author, Felix Guaderie, are trying to say is that, you...
they're kind of anarchists. I mean, they're just liberals in my mind, but, you know, they're the anarchist version of
liberalism.

PP: And they want to tear down absolutely all the hierarchies. They're in that real 60s mold of, like, the Freudian
vertical complexes in your head. Remember this Marcuse stuff from back in the 60s? Similar stuff, like, there's a
policeman inside of all of our heads, and he must be stopped, and it's the father, it's the, you know, everyone's
familiar with this in the kind of more watered-down version that came to the American shores.

PP: But the, basically, the best actual articulation of this, the most philosophically coherent, was this Deleuze and
Guaderie book. It's kind of fascinating in that regard.

PP: And what they're basically saying is, if you imagine

PP: if you imagine a society in terms of French... in terms of structuralist anthropology, you have all these social
structures built up of customs and norms and totems and taboos, as they'd say, you know, basically moral structures,
familial structures, all these kind of things.

PP: And Deleuze and Guadarri are saying, come in and smash it all, and then smash all the, like, representations you
have of it in your own head, and you'll come out free. And what Gerard is saying is exactly the opposite.

PP: He's saying that if you do that, you'll get absolute and utter chaos. And he's channeling that insight

PP: from the more classical authors, because he's... he's more of a classicist in that regard. And so he's exactly
saying what I'm saying.

PP: that if you actually try this tearing down of the hierarchies that liberalism promotes, in a sense, you will just
get absolute chaos. And into that chaos, first we'll flow violence, as is in Girard, and then we'll form exactly what
you've just said, a struggle for a new hierarchy.

PP: And a new hierarchy will just solidify. But this is what always happens with liberalism. Like today, right, I think
we're currently at complete peak liberalism.

PP: Do we have a society of zero hierarchies? Are you kidding me? We live in an oligarchy. We live in the most obvious
oligarchy I've ever seen. Who are these private equity guys going out and buying up your campground and telling you how
much money you have to pay to park your RV and grill a chicken?

PP: Like, these are oligarchs of the worst variety. So what happens is that when you smash all the good,
natural-law-based hierarchies, you get the formation of arbitrary power-based hierarchies.

And okay, maybe the really nice guys will win out in your struggle for power. Very good chance they won't, and
you'll just end up with this absolutely awful structure. But that awful structure will also be highly unstable, which is
what we see today. Because it's a hierarchical structure that's really overweening and oligarchic.

It generates resentment, and it generates another cycle of kind of chaos. So, yeah, while I'm not a
Girardian, per se, but it's definitely... a lot of these ideas from the same kind of French structuralist
tradition that Girard's from. From the other side of it, actually, the weirdo side of it in Paris.

GC: And it's fascinating that, anyone who challenges the oligarchy is anti-democratic, right?
That's their defense. Any challenge to their power is met with "Anti-democratic forces are threatening democracy!"

PP: And if you see that, of course, they'll just say there's a policeman in your head that's tricked you into thinking
about the wrong definition of democracy.

That's exactly it, right? They start off in the 60s telling you that your father's superego is talking to you in
your head, and then, like, one generational cycle later, it's like black is white. It's like Orwell 19... like,
democracy is oligarchy, or men are women, or... like, that's how it goes, you know? You get... break down the normal.

The normal familial psychology in a person, and then feed them the most weird, arbitrary, unnaturalhierarchies.
It's fascinating.

GC: Yeah, I now have a private equity firm in my head instead of a policeman, right?

PP: A policeman as well, a woke FBI agent!

GC: Yes, there you go. All right, well, thanks so much for your time, it's been great talking with you.
