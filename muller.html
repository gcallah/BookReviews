        <p>
            One way of defining "rationalism," the modern tendency critiqued by
            such figures as Michael Oakeshott, F.A. Hayek, and Michael Polanyi,
            is that it is the attempt to replace experience by technique. In
            his important new book, historian Jerry Muller takes on a
            particular species of rationalism: our modern fixation on replacing
            expert judgment with a sort of rule by quantifiable entities.
        </p>

        <p>
            This book has a target, which Muller calls "metric fixation."
            Both in his introductory material and in his latter case studies,
            he highlights the many pitfalls of this fixation: once we restrict
            our focus to certain aspects of a situation that we <i>can</i>
            measure, we lose sight of important things that we can't measure;
            we tempt people judged by some metric to ignore doing their best
            job and instead focus on winning at the metric game; and we
            encourage cheating to look good per the metric.
        </p>

        <p>
            An amusing example from my own profession, software engineering,
            nicely illustrates the second point: for a little while, there was
            a management fad to measure the "performance" of software engineers
            by counting how many lines of code they wrote per day. This was
            a bizarre idea, in that generally speaking, the best solution to a
            problem involves the <i>fewest</i> lines of code, not the most. But
            it also led to silliness like this: if I want to set a variable
            <i>x</i> to the value five, I would naturally just write "<i>x</i> =
            5". But once keeping my job depends on writing lots of lines of
            code, I can instead write:
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            Now I am "five times as productive" as if I had just written 
            "<i>x</i> = 5"!
        </p>


        <p>
            But if metrics, while useful, fall so short of their promise,
            why did they become so popular and ubiquitous? Muller explains this
            by noting that the rise of "neophyte elites" made the new holders
            of elite status anxious to justify their positions: unlikely to
            "feel secure in their judgments," they are "more likely to seek
            seemingly objective criteria by which to make decisions" (p. 40).
            Meanwhile, "when institutional establishments came under populist
            attack, they too resorted to metrics as a means of defense to
            demonstrate their effectiveness" (p. 41). Muller further contends
            that the "apotheosis of choice" added to the trend, as advocacy
            groups challenged the hegemony of experts: "The road to empowerment
            was paved with metrics" (p. 43). And the spread of computers made
            tools like spreadsheets seem like an easy way sum up an entire
            business without really understanding it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reliance on metrics in management seems to offer
            neophytes who know numbers a quick way to beat out competition with
            years of experience. As education in management gradually shifted
            from on-the-job training to education by management professors who
            may have never managed anything more complicated than their
            gradebook, the appeal of abstract methods of managing -- doing it
            "by the numbers" -- was bound to gain in popularity. An early form
            of this focus on measurements was Taylorism:
        </p>

        <p>
            "Taylorism was based on trying to replace the implicit knowledge of
            the workmen with mass production methods developed, planned,
            monitored, and controlled by managers. 'Under scientific
            management,' [Taylor] wrote, 'the managers assume... the burden of
            gathering together all the traditional knowledge which in the past
            has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying,
            tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae...
            Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the
            workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by
            management in accordance with the laws of science.' (pp.32-33)
        </p>

        <p>
            General Motors: "The managerial 'superstructure which
            organizes and directs production... draws all possible
            brainpower away from the shop; everything is centered in
            the planning and schedule and design departments.'" --
            Daniel Bell, quoted in Muller, p. 33
        </p>

        <p>
            "The core of managerial expertise was now defined as a distinct set
            of skills and techniques, focused upon a mastery of quantitative
            methodologies. Decisions based on sleep numbers were viewed as
            scientific, since numbers were thought to imply objectivity and
            accuracy...
        </p>

        <p>
            "Before that, 'expertise' meant the career long accumulation of
            knowledge of a specific field, as one progressed from rung to rung
            within the same institution or business... Auto executives were
            'car guys' -- men who had spent much of their professional life in
            the automotive industry. They were increasingly replaced by
            McNamara-like 'bean counters,' adept at calculating costs and
            profit margins.
        </p>

        <p>
            "[This trend] morphed into the gospel of managerialism. The role of
            judgment grounded in experience and a deep knowledge of context was
            downplayed. The premise of managerialism is that the differences
            among organizations -- including private corporations, government
            agencies, and universities -- are less important than the
            similarities. Thus the performance of all organizations can be
            optimized using the same toolkit of managerial techniques and
            skills." -- pp. 34-35.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another reason he notes
            is that the rise of principal-agent theory claimed that management
            could not be trusted to act in the owners' behalf, unless their
            performance was tightly monitored with... metrics.
        </p>


        <p>
            Muller understands his critique of metric fixation as part of
            a larger case against what Michael Oakeshott called 
            "rationalism." This is illustrated, for instance, by his statement
            of one of the "key components" of metric fixation: "the belief that
            it is possible and desirable to replace judgment, acquired by
            personal experience and talent, with numerical indicators of
            comparative performance based upon standardized data (metrics)" (p. 18).
            And he knows his forebears, specifically citing Oakeshott, F.A.
            Hayek, Michael Polanyi, and James C. Scott. He cites Oakeshott as
            criticizing rationalists for their belief that "the conduct of
            human affairs is a matter of applying the right formulas or
            recipes.
        </p>


        <p>
            He extends Hayek's argument against central planning to apply also
            to "rationalist" factory managers: "Just as Soviet bloc planners
            set output targets for each factory to produce, so do bureaucrats
            set measurable performance targets for schools, hospitals, police
            forces, and corporations. And just as Soviet managers responded by
            producing shoddy goods that met the numerical targets set by their
            overlords, so do schools, police forces, and business find ways of
            of fulfilling quotas with shoddy goods of their own by graduating
            pupils with minimal skills, or downgrading grand theft to
            misdemeanor-level petty larceny, or opening dummy accounts for bank
            clients" (p. 81).
        </p>

        <p>
            Calculation cannot encompass "the entrepeneurial discovery of how
            to meet particular needs and how to generate new goals
            As Muller puts it, "The calculative is the enemy of the
            imaginative" (p. 61).
        </p>

        <p>
            "Judgment is a sort of skill at grasping the unique particularities
            of a situation" (p. 62). 
        </p>

        <p>
            The Thachter regime in the UK was distinctly anti-conservative, in
            that it sought to substitute "recipes" for experience, as political
            theorist Eli Kedourie noted at the time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Critics of Oakeshott and similar thinkers
            often mistake their critique of rationalism as a
            disguised defense of the status quo in politics. But Oakeshott
            himself extended the critique well beyond politics, and others have
            gone further than him: Michael Polanyi carried it to science,
            Ludwig Wittgenstein to philosophy, Jane Jacobs to urban planning,
            James C. Scott to forestry and agriculture, Nassim Taleb to finance
            and to religion, myself to software engineering, and here, Muller
            to management and metric fixation in general.
            "Rationalism" is not mainly a political phenomenon,
            nor is it exclusively right-wing or left-wing: rather, it is an
            obsession with replacing experience and judgment with formal
            techniques, based on a mistaken understanding of what is (falsely)
            supposed to itself be a single technique called "the scientific
            method."
        </p>

        <p>
            After discussing the history and theory of metric fixation, Muller
            turns to its contemporary practice: in particular, in turn, he
            addresses higher education, schools, medicine, policing, the
            military, business and finance, and philanthropy and foreign aid.
            In each domain he cites numerous examples of the deletrious effects
            of metric fixation, of which we will visit some highlights.
