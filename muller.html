            One way of defining "rationalism," the modern tendency critiqued by
            such figures as Michael Oakeshott, F.A. Hayek, and Michael Polanyi,
            is that it is the attempt to replace experience by technique. In
            his important new book, historian Jerry Muller takes on a
            particular species of rationalism: our modern fixation on replacing
            expert judgment with a sort of rule by quantifiable entities.
        </p>

        <p>
            This book has a target, which Muller calls "metric fixation."
            Muller's critique of metric fixation overlaps my work on
            rationalism, as shown by his statement of one of the "key
            components" of metric fixation: "the belief that it is possible and
            desirable to replace judgment, acquired by personal experience and
            talent, with numerical indicators of comparative performance based
            upon standardized data (metrics)" (p. 18).

            Rationalism in Management
        </h3>

        <p>
            "Taylorism was based on trying to replace the implicit knowledge of
            the workmen with mass production methods developed, planned,
            monitored, and controlled by managers. 'Under scientific
            management,' [Taylor] wrote, 'the managers assume... the burden of
            gathering together all the traditional knowledge which in the past
            has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying,
            tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae...
            Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the
            workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by
            management in accordance with the laws of science.' (pp.32-33)
        </p>

        <p>
            General Motors: "The managerial 'superstructure which
            organizes and directs production... draws all possible
            brainpower away from the shop; everything is centered in
            the planning and schedule and design departments.'" --
            Daniel Bell, quoted in Muller, p. 33
        </p>

        <p>
            "The core of managerial expertise was now defined as a distinct set
            of skills and techniques, focused upon a mastery of quantitative
            methodologies. Decisions based on sleep numbers were viewed as
            scientific, since numbers were thought to imply objectivity and
            accuracy...
        </p>

        <p>
            "Before that, 'expertise' meant the career long accumulation of
            knowledge of a specific field, as one progressed from rung to rung
            within the same institution or business... Auto executives were
            'car guys' -- men who had spent much of their professional life in
            the automotive industry. They were increasingly replaced by
            McNamara-like 'bean counters,' adept at calculating costs and
            profit margins.
        </p>

        <p>
            "[This trend] morphed into the gospel of managerialism. The role of
            judgment grounded in experience and a deep knowledge of context was
            downplayed. The premise of managerialism is that the differences
            among organizations -- including private corporations, government
            agencies, and universities -- are less important than the
            similarities. Thus the performance of all organizations can be
            optimized using the same toolkit of managerial techniques and
            skills." -- pp. 34-35.
        </p>

        <p>
            Critics of Oakeshott often mistake his critique of rationalism as a
            disguised defense of the status quo in politics. But Oakeshott
            himself extended the critique well beyond politics, and others have
            gone further than him: Michael Polanyi extended it to science,
            Ludwig Wittgenstein to philosophy, Jane Jacobs to urban planning,
            James C. Scott to forestry and agriculture, Nassim Taleb to finance
            and to religion, myself to software engineering, and here, Muller
            to management. "Rationalism" is not mainly a political phenomenon,
            nor is it exclusively right-wing or left-wing: rather, it is an
            obsession with replacing experience and judgment with formal
            techniques, based on a mistaken understanding of what is (falsely)
            supposed to itself be a single technique called "the scientific
            method."

            Why Metrics Became So Popular
        </h3>

        <p>
            But if metrics, while useful, fall so short of their promise,
            why did they become so popular and ubiquitous? Muller explains this
            by noting that the rise of "neophyte elites" made the new holders
            of elite status anxious to justify their positions: unlikely to
            "feel secure in their judgments," they are "more likely to seek
            seemingly objective criteria by which to make decisions" (p. 40).
            Meanwhile, "when institutional establishments came under populist
            attack, they too resorted to metrics as a means of defense to
            demonstrate their effectiveness" (p. 41). Muller further contends
            that the "apotheosis of choice" added to the trend, as advocacy
            groups challenged the hegemony of experts: "The road to empowerment
            was paved with metrics" (p. 43). And the spread of computers made
            tools like spreadsheets seem like an easy way sum up an entire
            business without really understanding it.

        <h3>
            Philosophical Critiques
        </h3>

        <p>
            Muller draws on thinkers such as Michael Oakeshott, F.A. Hayek,
            Michael Polanyi, and James C. Scott to provide a philosophical
            critique of why the rationalist reliance on metrics is ill-founded.
            He extends Hayek's argument against central planning to apply also
            to "rationalist" factory managers: "Just as Soviet bloc planners
            set output targets for each factory to produce, so do bureaucrats
            set measurable performance targets fo schools, hospitals, police
            forces, and corporations. And just as Soviet managers responded by
            producing shoddy goods that met the numerical targets set by their
            overlords, so do schools, police forces, and business find ways of
            of fulfilling quotas with shoddy goods of their own by graduating
            pupils with minimal skills, or downgrading grand theft to
            misdemeanor-level petty larceny, or opening dummy accounts for bank
            clients" (p. 81).
        </p>


        <p>
            Calculation cannot encompass "the entrepeneurial discovery of how
            to meet particular needs and how to generate new goals
            As Muller puts it, "The calculative is the enemy of the
            imaginative" (p. 61).
        </p>

        <p>
            "Judgment is a sort of skill at grasping the unigue particularities
            of a situation" (p. 62).

        <p>
            The Thachter regime in the UK was distinctly anti-conservative, in
            that it sought to substitute "recipes" for experience, as political
            theorist Eli Kedourie noted at the time.
