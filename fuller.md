# Michael Oakeshott on the Human Condition
## Essays by Timothy Fuller

Timothy Fuller


Modes: 

Fuller writes that, "for the philosopher such a proclamation of self-satisfaction must be treated with skepticism." (4)

Treating them with "skepticism" implies that such a view might be correct. But it seems to me that Oakeshott views them
as demonstrably mistaken: since the modes construct from the whole of experience " a restricted world of abstract ideas"
(EAIM 70), they are necessarily partial and defective. No, Fuller understands this quite well, as shown by the next few
pages of his essay. But that makes the choice of "skeptical" more puzzling, not less.


Fuller next takes up the work of John Hopkins political theorist Richard Flathman, looks at authority, using an
"amalgamation of elements from different categories of understanding" 58

Thus, like Locke, Flathman would have it two ways at once: the threat of the appeal to heaven will help keep the
authorities skittish about the exercise of authority, and most people will perhaps find it to their advantage to be
governed by those who are skittish about governing" 64


The next essay is the text of the eulogy that Fuller delivered at the LSE memorial service following Oakeshott's
passing. In it, we learn of Oakeshott's for the American West, and his non-utilitarian understanding of the purpose of
higher education. 


The chapter entitled "Michael Oakeshott's Political Thought" intriguingly begins with an extended discussion of his
religious thought. This is an aspect of Oakeshott's interests that, after the early 1930s, he was "reticent" to discuss,
but Fuller tells us that his study of theology was a lifelong pursuit. Fuller notes that "[Oakeshott] thought that St.
Augustine enjoyed the greatest religious imagination within our tradition and after him Pascal" 83.


Franco and Orr can't both be correct, and one wishes Fuller had tried to adjudicate their dispute a little more
decisively. I suspect that he, like I, would come down on the side of Franco, and say that Orr simply misunderstood what
Oakeshott was up to.

Agents: 87

MO explained right in the very book Orr objects to what he was up to: he was "dropping anchor" with a certain set of
theoretical nets to see what fish could be caught at that location.




"MO was not urging us to be conservative â€“ he was arguing that we could not help but be so. To deny this is not only to
disguise the truth about ourselves, but also to lead us into ill-considered projects for transforming the human race"
104

But to embark upon "ill-considered projects for transforming the human race" would seem to me to be the very paradigm of
being "not conservative."
