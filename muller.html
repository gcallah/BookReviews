            One way of defining "rationalism," the modern tendency critiqued by
            such figures as Michael Oakeshott, F.A. Hayek, and Michael Polanyi,
            is that it is the attempt to replace experience by technique. In
            his important new book, historian Jerry Muller takes on a
            particular species of rationalism: our modern fixation on replacing
            expert judgment with a sort of rule by quantifiable entities.

            This book has a target, which Muller calls "metric fixation."
            Muller's critique of metric fixation overlaps my work on
            rationalism, as shown by his statement of one of the "key
            components" of metric fixation: "the belief that it is possible and
            desirable to replace judgment, acquired by personal experience and
            talent, with numerical indicators of comparative performance based
            upon standardized data (metrics)" (p. 18).

            "Taylorism was based on trying to replace the implicit knowledge of
            the workmen with mass production methods developed, planned,
            monitored, and controlled by managers. 'Under scientific
            management,' [Taylor] wrote, 'the managers assume... the burden of
            gathering together all the traditional knowledge which in the past
            has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying,
            tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae...
            Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the
            workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by
            management in accordance with the laws of science.' (pp.32-33)
