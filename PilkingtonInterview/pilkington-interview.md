1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.870
Eugene Callahan: So… Alright.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.610
Eugene Callahan: Alright, so,

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:16.280
Eugene Callahan: I just finished, your book on the collapse of global liberalism. I haven't read… you have a previous book on economics?

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:34.060
Philip: Yeah, I wrote it a long time ago, when I was, like, 26, so it's, it's on economic theory, it's, it's not, well, it's on economic theory and the epistemology of economic theory, but it's, it's very different from the previous book.

5
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.729
Eugene Callahan: Oh, alright. Well, I'd like to get to that one, but I haven't. Why don't we start,

6
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:51.519
Eugene Callahan: So, I think there's a potential confusion for American readers in that, typical American usage, liberalism.

7
00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.660
Eugene Callahan: signifies someone left of center, right? Now, you're using it in the sense of people have said that,

8
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.379
Eugene Callahan: at least… You know, I think Trump is…

9
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:25.159
Eugene Callahan: still basically a liberal, but at least before Trump, what you had in America was left liberals and right liberals. So, perhaps you can talk a little bit about how you're using the word liberalism differently than this American sense, and,

10
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.059
Eugene Callahan: What, what you see this global liberalism is that's collapsing.

11
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:52.159
Philip: Yeah, I'm actually… I'm weirdly sympathetic to the American use of liberal. I know there's kind of a… we all grow up if we kind of go to college or, you know, we interact with academic types and so on, and Europeans and, you know, classical liberals and so on will be very…

12
00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:03.680
Philip: kind of snobby about the fact that America's supposedly distorted the use of the term liberal by referring to the mainstream of Democratic Party

13
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.639
Philip: Political culture.

14
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:20.899
Philip: And I think you're absolutely right that the main dividing line in American politics has not been liberal and conservative per se, it's been left liberal and right liberal. At the same time, I think people are kind of onto something when they see the very…

15
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:35.800
Philip: end result, shall we say, I would consider the end result of liberals… liberalism's march in the form of the progressive liberalism that we see in the Democratic Party today, which has now spread, of course, to all.

16
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.859
Philip: of Europe, and to… especially to the Anglo countries, like Ireland and Britain, and Australia and Canada, and so on. I think there's actually something to that.

17
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:56.660
Philip: I'm referring to liberalism in a very broad historic, sense. So, I consider the beginning of liberalism the main political event to have been the English Civil War.

18
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.120
Philip: Which is a misnomer, it wasn't a civil war, it was a revolution.

19
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:17.410
Philip: the English covered that up because they wanted to, promote constitutional continuity. But it's not true. There was a revolution, a king had his head chopped off. It was just like the French Revolution. It worked a little bit differently. Armies fought against each other. But, there was, there was a beheading of a monarch.

20
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:36.210
Philip: the establishment of a dictatorship under Oliver Cromwell, and there was enormous social upheaval, cultural and social upheaval, the stripping of the churches and so on, the attempt to strip what was left of Anglican… Anglican culture out of the churches, because it too much so resembled Catholicism to the Puritans.

21
00:03:36.280 --> 00:04:01.249
Philip: You can now say that the roots, the ideological roots of liberalism go back to the Reformation. I know, Brad S. Gregory wrote a book about that. I totally agree with what he's saying, but I think the English Civil War, so-called, the English Revolution is what it really was, was actually the first, the first movement, political movement of liberalism, and it ended up establishing the first major republic in the

22
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:24.479
Philip: form of the English… the short-lived English republic. The other republics prior to that were Minor, Calvin's Geneva, a few in Venice, and so on. I think they were just experimenting with sort of a Greek form of government. But in terms of modern, what I would say, liberal republics, I think Cromwell was the first. And then, who comes along and ideologizes Cromwell, but John Locke, in his two treatises on government?

23
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.940
Philip: interestingly, this is pretty consciously… this was understood at the time. John Locke did not publish the two treatises under his own name.

24
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:46.879
Philip: He did publish his actual philosophical, his empirical philosophy work under his own name, but he, published the two treaties as under a separate name, and that's because the restoration had already happened.

25
00:04:47.130 --> 00:05:02.269
Philip: And he knew that the two treaties of some government was… would have been considered a partial justification, or argument for aspects of the government that were put in place under the Cromwellian parliamentary dictatorship.

26
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:21.329
Philip: And what was this all about? Well, I think there's an absolute continuity between those two moments in history right up to the present day of transgender ideology. I don't see any difference between the ideas, and the ideas are effectively anti-hierarchical.

27
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:31.519
Philip: The entire premise of liberalism, on my reading of it, the fundamental idea, is that there should not be arbitrary hierarchies in society.

28
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:43.250
Philip: At all. And this starts off with questioning the status of the king, and the church, and the episcopate. These are the easy targets in 17th century Britain.

29
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.560
Philip: or England, I should say, Britain didn't exist.

30
00:05:46.690 --> 00:06:09.380
Philip: And then these, these, these, the hierarchies become increasingly questioned as time goes on. So, just to give one example, again, from the early modern, modern, early modern and early modern, modern period, in the French Revolution, the revolutionaries do kill the king. They… they dispute the, hierarchy of the king and establish the French Republic.

31
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.939
Philip: But unlike the Puritans, they actually try and overturn Christian religion altogether.

32
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:36.849
Philip: they try and impose a cult of reason, and put a prostitute in Notre Dame Cathedral. So you're seeing that over time, it becomes more radical. The Puritans were happy with a very stripped-down form of Protestant religion, you know, very individualistic, and no ornamentation, and no hierarchy in the church, and so on. These are the more radical Puritans. I know there are

33
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:47.200
Philip: Presbyterians are different, but that was the tendency it was moving in. And then by the time you get to the French Revolution, Voltaire had already made his attacks on the church and so on, and then they just want to tear the whole thing down.

34
00:06:47.270 --> 00:07:04.729
Philip: Now, just really briefly, we continue to see these questioning of hierarchies move all the way up to the present day when we question gender hierarchies. It seems to be almost the pinnacle of the entire liberal project. The family comes in for criticism and so on. But the one thing I want to make clear is

35
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.470
Philip: That it's not…

36
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:30.880
Philip: Whig history is liberal history. It pretends that there's a linear trajectory to this. There isn't. It tends to… it tends to move in kind of fits and starts. So some of the liberal principles in the French Revolution, for example, that were put into place, for example, metric clocks, strange calendars, these kind of things, attempts to impose very strange principles of rationality on the population.

37
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:55.229
Philip: would have later been seen as radical by, you know, fairly radical Whigs in the late 19th century. So there's no… there's no actual straight line with liberalism. It's more like a… it's more like an up… up… uphill slope that's kind of bumpy, and it goes through fits and starts. But I think today we have actually reached the end of it, and I know that's an enormously controversial claim, because we're talking about a

38
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.080
Philip: half-millennia-old political movement.

39
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:07.720
Eugene Callahan: So you mentioned Bach as a founding figure here. How does Hobbes fit in to your story? How do you see his work?

40
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.660
Eugene Callahan: Being placed in this…

41
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:26.710
Philip: I think Hobbes is kind of a fascinating figure. You have to kind of tie him to the philosophy of Francis Bacon as well. I think what they're doing is they're reintroducing some sort of materialism. I think that's effectively what they're doing. They're kind of…

42
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:45.320
Philip: putting aside the medieval tradition altogether, this goes back to these Protestant debates, and to what extent Protestantism influenced liberalism, which I want to make clear to anyone who's listening and reading that I do not discuss in the book. I think Brad S. Gregory's book is very good on that.

43
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.320
Philip: But basically, I think they're bringing back

44
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:55.009
Philip: A form of materialism that didn't really exist until then.

45
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:10.689
Philip: I don't think Hobbes, for example, or Bacon for that matter, Bacon's not a political philosopher, obviously, I don't think Hobbes is a liberal per se, but he's kind of laying the groundwork for the sort of anti-hierarchical thought that's necessary

46
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.670
Philip: for liberalism. He's reducing people to homogeneous atoms and so on.

47
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:39.400
Philip: he's kind of leveling things in an ideational sense, but I think he's doing it more for materialistic reasons, and I think in order to get into all that, you have to go back into these, you know, nominalist and realist debates that go on in the medieval period and the growth of materialism. I think all of this is absolutely true, but, you know, if you start writing a history of this stuff, you end up back at, you know.

48
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:51.390
Philip: democritis or something like that, and you have to put a hard limit in. So, I definitely think the prehistory of liberalism is, in a sense, as important as the history of liberalism.

49
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.860
Philip: But you have to start somewhere.

50
00:09:53.220 --> 00:10:01.500
Eugene Callahan: Right, sure. I had the interesting experience rereading Leviathan that,

51
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:08.189
Eugene Callahan: The materialist philosophy, well, he… he reaches what are sometimes nonsense

52
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:16.290
Eugene Callahan: kind of explanations for things. If you, so he was very into,

53
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:29.250
Eugene Callahan: what Boyle and Descartes and Cassandi were doing with, physical explanations. So he's got… he posits something like frigarific particles that cause coldness.

54
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:41.459
Eugene Callahan: And explains how they circulate and make you cold. But, it really was not… my experience was it wasn't that connected. He could have dropped that out, and then…

55
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:55.890
Eugene Callahan: written something about how we all fear death, and it's gonna be chaos if we don't have a sovereign. And, this… that part was… struck me as much better reasoning than his, materialist psychology.

56
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.500
Eugene Callahan: Which was interesting.

57
00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.700
Eugene Callahan: Bum.

58
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:13.529
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, so you… your main claim is that liberalism is on the verge of collapse. Now, I agree with your diagnosis of the problems that it's, spawning.

59
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:23.239
Eugene Callahan: But, writing the book review, I thought about the history of Rome. Now, Cursed Rome has a change

60
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:33.480
Eugene Callahan: In fact, the regime changes, although on the surface, Augustus keeps every… he keeps all the forms of the Republic.

61
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:49.850
Eugene Callahan: But, in fact, establishes the Prince of It. But you can see collapse happening by the time of the Grocke brothers, around 120 BC, where they're populists who are both killed, and then there's civil wars, and…

62
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:59.410
Eugene Callahan: And, whatnot, but in one form or another, this polity limps along until 1453, when Constantinople falls.

63
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.610
Eugene Callahan: So…

64
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:16.929
Eugene Callahan: why… why would we think that liberalism won't kind of lurch from crisis to crisis with, you know, some calmer periods for some indeterminate length of time? Why should we think that collapse is imminent?

65
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:28.630
Philip: I think the collapse here that we're talking about is, in some sense, potential civilizational collapse. It doesn't have to be, we can pull out of it, I think.

66
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:52.679
Philip: which, you're right, Rome effectively civilizationally collapses, there's no doubt about that, and that… those kind of things take a long line, as you said. And, you know, some people could even claim that Rome never collapsed, and that modern Europe is Rome, and I'm sympathetic to some of those arguments. But the issue with liberalism is pretty different, to my mind, because Rome, for all its faults.

67
00:12:52.850 --> 00:13:06.089
Philip: Rome kind of rises and falls like a normal kind of empire. It's the kind of normal rise and fall story, but the governance structures of Rome, the ideas on which it were founded, were not really the problem.

68
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:16.139
Philip: They were… it was a political problem in Rome. It was over-expansion due to empire. We all know… I don't know if everyone knows the story, but I think everyone used to know the story, and some people know the story today.

69
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:30.049
Philip: That's a political issue. We still, if you go to a courtroom in Europe, you're operating under very obvious aspects of Roman law, and those things continue on even in the Anglo-Saxon

70
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:47.389
Philip: legal tradition. I don't think Rome ever really was discredited, in a sense. Maybe some of the barbaric practices, pre-Christian practices, were by the emergence of Christianity, but I don't think Rome ever was intellectually discredited. I don't even know what that would really mean.

71
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.020
Philip: Liberalism's a very different beast, because,

72
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.430
Philip: I don't think it actually works as a governing structure. I don't think it can work.

73
00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:20.360
Philip: I think it's very similar to Marxist communism in that way. Marxist communism, as you know, if you read the book, I'd consider just a slightly radical offshoot cousin of liberalism. Although, in some senses, as Rose Lugoutko has pointed out, liberalism is more radical than Marxist communism, in some ways. Not on the economic side, but on the, on the… in practice anyway, on the… on the attacks on family and so on.

74
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:32.929
Philip: And the church. And it's more deeply rooted, which is interesting. But the issue is that liberalism… liberalism kind of was never properly tried. It's been around for 500 years.

75
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:41.800
Philip: And over those 500 years, it's been an enormously popular ideology among the bohemian side of the elite, let's just say.

76
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:57.430
Philip: Increasingly then, in the 20th century, probably around… well, I'd say in the late 19th century, it had already risen to kind of mainstream in Britain, and then it was obviously mainstream in the American global period after 1945.

77
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:11.679
Philip: But as I say in the book, I kind of classify between two different things. You have kind of soft liberalism and hard liberalism on the one hand, and soft liberalism is when liberalism kind of mixes with non-liberal aspects of society.

78
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:21.549
Philip: In the West, again, we can refer back to, kind of, Roman legal structures, Christian moral structures, you know, the foundations of Western civilization.

79
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.369
Philip: And it can kind of glom onto them.

80
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.940
Philip: And your society can have limited aspects of liberalism.

81
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:34.480
Philip: I consider it kind of parasiting off those more hierarchical structures.

82
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:57.579
Philip: And, as I said, it goes in fits and starts. Occasionally, you get this burst of hard liberalism. For example, I think the English Civil War was, I think the, even more profoundly, the French Revolution was. The 1848 revolutions were bursts of hard liberalism. The Paris Commune, I might get the date wrong, 1873, I think, was another burst of hard liberalism.

83
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.940
Philip: And then the Marxist revolutions after are slightly different, but they're kind of… sort of similar.

84
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.459
Philip: That what happened was that these were very short-lived.

85
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:17.480
Philip: These were very short-lived, and they tended to provoke an almost immediate reaction, maybe within, like, less than a generation, and you'd get some sort of restoration.

86
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:31.209
Philip: And it will be remixed. You might get a more liberal regime in Napoleon III or something like that, but it's intermixed with the, you know, the regal structures, or the church structures, or whatever.

87
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:39.000
Philip: the French were particularly good at coming up with these hybrid soft-liberal republics, one after the other, you know?

88
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:57.319
Philip: But… and the Americans did, too, in a different way. But the, but that's basically what happened. Now, what that meant was that liberalism never really penetrated deeply into the social fabric at all. I mean, for most of the liberal period, if you want to call those 500 years the liberal period.

89
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:21.650
Philip: most people in the West lived Christian lives. Even if they didn't believe in 1890 in Britain, even if they all just pretended to believe, they lived in line with Christian morality. They really did. And so people were living Christian lives. When they went to a courtroom, they were governed by some sort of Roman legal principles, right? This is… married with Christian ethical principles.

90
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.720
Philip: This is how people live day to day. And you'd see these occasional ups.

91
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:31.570
Philip: surges in what I'd choose, and then they'd be put back to bed very, very quickly.

92
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:40.039
Philip: Since about 1990, that has not been the case. This is the period I call hyperliberalism in the book.

93
00:17:40.040 --> 00:18:04.939
Philip: that what's happened is liberalism has been gradually, but quite quickly, introduced into the body politic, right down to all levels. So, just to give an example, if you go back to the early 19th century, early 20th century, I should say, British elite, okay? You can read loads of novels from that period, Evelyn War, something like that, and you'll see these people

94
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:12.559
Philip: and you'll say, I know these people. These are liberals. These are the same decadent, bohemian liberals that I see today, you know?

95
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:36.280
Philip: And they were everywhere in the British elite back then, and there were some in America, too, Mabel, Dodge, Lewin, and these people, artistic bohemian types, but they were quite powerful, and they'd go on to influence various things. But they were always in the elite crust, right? And that was often the case with these more radical liberal thinkers. You might go back to, John, John Stuart Millen, and so on, these experimental

96
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:44.969
Philip: Godwin, and these guys. But… What happened in the 1990s was that bohemian hyperliberalism was democratized.

97
00:18:45.110 --> 00:19:04.999
Philip: And it was sent down right into the… into the, groundwork, the groundwater, as it were, of our societies. And I think by about the second Obama administration, society had be… had succumbed to complete liberalization. Complete. And we are currently living in the… in the…

98
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.250
Philip: In the debris of that right now.

99
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:24.399
Philip: That the liberalism is now how people self-identify. It is how they live their lives. Even the people who don't want to be liberals, like you and me, we have to live in it. And, like, you can't get away from it. That's how society is. And here's the thing, I don't think that's sustainable.

100
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:47.620
Philip: I don't think that is a possible way to govern a society. So the key answer is, oh, so can we go back to soft liberalism? Can we go back to Coca-Cola and glass bottles in 1956 California? No, I don't think so. Because once you actually try the ideology, it discredits itself, just like central planning did in the USSR.

101
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.830
Eugene Callahan: What do you think, why was… So…

102
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:59.329
Eugene Callahan: Given these ideas were around, and they were circulating amongst elites who,

103
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:08.520
Eugene Callahan: For the most part, I mean, there were always elites who thought that I can live this way, but God forbid the common person should.

104
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:20.840
Eugene Callahan: Right? That… that was out there. But, given that a lot of the elites thought that these ideas should spread, we should liberate the common people too, why in the 90s, in particular, was this able…

105
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:28.269
Eugene Callahan: Were they able to actually spread liberalism throughout society, whereas earlier, they hadn't?

106
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:43.970
Philip: It's a really good question. I have not addressed in the book, to be clear. It's a very complex question, and I think it's one that's been debated, especially in American conservative circles. I think this is the big question in American conservative circles.

107
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:51.050
Philip: I think probably, I'm not gonna say anything terribly original here. I think a lot of it had to do with the 60s.

108
00:20:51.430 --> 00:21:12.429
Philip: I think that this cultural revolution was democratized. It then became commercialized. I think that was really important. The mass consumer commercial culture wasn't there in the past to catch hold of these ideas and democratize them and spread them throughout society. But even after the 60s and the weirdo 70s, as I've heard them referred to sometimes.

109
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:23.689
Philip: They… these ideas still kind of, like, 1983, America was a lot more liberal than 1953 America, but it… it wasn't liberalized at that point.

110
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:33.810
Philip: So, there was still some blockage there, but there was a lot… it feels to me, I didn't look through it, obviously, but from reading about it and so on, it feels like there was… there was a lot of pent-up

111
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:45.850
Philip: desire to spread it out. And then I think, basically, the Cold War collapsed. The Cold War collapsed, the greatest generation, who were soft liberals, I'd call them, died off. I think, like, the last…

112
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:54.529
Philip: the last non-hyper-liberal president was probably George H.W. Bush, right? And then in comes Clinton, and it all starts going.

113
00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:10.419
Philip: And and so these were the baby boomers, they'd never experienced war or conflict themselves. I mean, maybe some of them… I'm not saying everybody, but the elite ones, certainly not. They dodged the draft in Vietnam and so on. And then they came in, and they were told, you run the world now.

114
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:25.510
Philip: They were told, you run the world now, and there is absolutely no limits to your power. There is no checks and balances on your power, you don't have to think about that at all. And then they were handed extremely highly developed mass media systems, propaganda systems.

115
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:43.999
Philip: And I think all of that just came together, you know, the perfect mix. And they went for it. And then when it reaches its zenith, when it really kicks into high gear in the second Obama administration, we have the new internet tools to spread it, which are, you know, mass psychological manipulation techniques. I mean, really military-grade

116
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.009
Philip: Psychological warfare operations, that's what we're… the hardware that we're currently operating on.

117
00:22:49.680 --> 00:23:08.040
Eugene Callahan: I saw somebody, posted a cartoon where guys at the CIA were talking, and they said, you know, we've tried for years to find a way that we could track what every American was up to, and know what, you know, what they did in every day, but now, we have Facebook and they just tell us.

118
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.350
Philip: Just exactly.

119
00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:25.729
Eugene Callahan: All right, at one point, you write that, a society that organizes itself in line with human nature will be stable, prosperous, and its inhabitants will be content and happy.

120
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.540
Eugene Callahan: So,

121
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:46.569
Eugene Callahan: I think it's a sound idea to organize a society in line with human nature, but this line seems kind of optimistic to me. If we look, Eden was in line with… organized in line with human nature, and yet we fell.

122
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:57.239
Eugene Callahan: And, you even have someone like Plato saying, hey, even if we could establish the very best republic, it will decay, you know, given human nature.

123
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:09.750
Eugene Callahan: So, and then there's the issue of, this society maybe going along fine on its own. I don't know what the political situation in Poland was like in 1939.

124
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:18.359
Eugene Callahan: But you have a good society, and you have two big, aggressive neighbors, and they, you know, end it for you. So,

125
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.140
Eugene Callahan: If,

126
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:30.019
Eugene Callahan: Can you discuss whether that… that is… you think that it's over-optimistic? Well, you wrote it, I guess… I guess you don't, but,

127
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:39.370
Eugene Callahan: I just, agreeing with the goal, I just, wondered, can we really say that, these good things will follow?

128
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:49.470
Philip: Well, I'm definitely not a utopian at all. I mean, I think I basically think in line with classical political philosophy, I think…

129
00:24:49.490 --> 00:25:07.919
Philip: Plato, Aristotle, those kind of things, and I… I think maybe what I'm saying is that, I mean, in the ideal, if you can best organize a society in line with human nature, yeah, something like Plato's Republic, not in the government structures. I think people focus too much. Oh, is it a dictatorship? That stuff…

130
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:31.949
Philip: It's not what Plato's talking about, it's a thought experiment. I hope people are sophisticated enough to know. But the, you know, if you can organize it in line with that, you probably have the best of all possible worlds, right? I mean, and it's not going to last forever, history changes, and it'll probably decay. I definitely buy into a cycle of regimes argument. We didn't have the Garden of Eden until the English Civil War.

131
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:50.749
Philip: Or until the Protestant Reformation, like, thinking that would be crazy, right? I mean, that would just kind of be nonsensical, but it's more of a… I mean, some of the criticisms I got for the book are because I kind of… it almost reads like a Hegelian book, and it kind of is, in a sense, to be honest.

132
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.250
Philip: Even though I'm not a…

133
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.800
Eugene Callahan: Like, you're breaking up.

134
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.050
Philip: But, but, you know, it's, it's, it's always in a process.

135
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:07.169
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, you broke up a little bit there. Let's see, let's try to soldier on and see how it goes. But we did have a gap.

136
00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:12.009
Eugene Callahan: In what you were saying. But, now it's okay, so continue.

137
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.140
Philip: Sorry, I'll just…

138
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:25.240
Philip: Okay, I was just… I was just saying, you know, I got some criticism, especially from more, Christian thinkers, that I was relying overly on a kind of Hegelian methodology in the book.

139
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:49.450
Philip: And I accept that, because I think Hegel's a liberal, actually. I just wrote a piece for post-liberal Order responding to them, saying basically that I agree with their criticisms of Hegel, but the… I guess what maybe is of value in those type of Hegelian process philosophies or something is that, you know, everything is kind of in a state of becoming, in a sense. There is no end telos in this world.

140
00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.830
Philip: Catholic, so I think there is an antilic, but not in this world.

141
00:26:53.090 --> 00:27:07.419
Philip: And and basically, what you're kind of doing, trying to establish a decent society, is just build in as much natural law as possible, to my mind. And the more natural law you build in, the more content

142
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:21.619
Philip: people will be Eudomania, or whatever, you know, they won't be perfectly satisfied. People aren't like that. They're funny, strange creatures, but, you know, it's the best, it's the best you're gonna get. And you can, you know, compare

143
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:30.779
Philip: America in 1955 with America in 2025. And you can say that one of them is a better, more stable society than the other. I think you can say that.

144
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:55.529
Philip: And why is that? Because people are more so adhering in 1955 to natural law structures. You know, everything. Family structures, respect for authority, respect for teachers, that's a big thing in Plato that we forget about today. So, you know, I think that… I don't think there's a perfect society, I don't think there ever is, and in fact, one of the main points I've been making in interviews since the book came

145
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:02.989
Philip: is that we're going to see a multitude of different civilizational societies emerge, from the Chinese to the Russian to the Indian.

146
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:26.649
Philip: to the neo-Ottoman Turkic, probably, to the neo-Shia Iran. I mean, these are going to be different societies, and they're going to look very different, but I think what they'll share in common is that they'll be aspiring to something resembling natural law thinking. And of course, natural law thinking doesn't just exist in the West. I've been over to China twice this year, talking with Confucian scholars and so on, and there's

147
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:47.049
Philip: I am of the view, the Jesuit view, that there is definitely natural law thinking in, for example, Confucius, which is pretty much as advanced as our pagan thinkers, just to point out. So, it'll look different elsewhere, and it'll never be per… it'll… everywhere, and it'll never be perfect, but, you know, that's just the… that's the human condition, in a sense.

148
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.490
Eugene Callahan: Wow, the fuck?

149
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:59.099
Eugene Callahan: Right, so we're both, readers of John Gray, and

150
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:12.280
Eugene Callahan: his recent… You know, I think… well, I think he's been saying this since the 90s. He just came out with a column in the New Statesman, an essay in The New Statesman, reiterating this. And…

151
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:17.149
Eugene Callahan: Well, he has many criticisms of liberalism.

152
00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:32.030
Eugene Callahan: He doesn't think that there is… you know, what he sees as the actual, best thing we can do, given our situation, is a kind of modus vivendi liberalism that

153
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:37.550
Eugene Callahan: Stops trying to… Invade…

154
00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:52.289
Eugene Callahan: subcultures and liberalize them, right? That allows Muslims to be Muslims, and allows, Mormons to be Mormons, and the Amish to be Amish, and accepts this diversity.

155
00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:59.760
Eugene Callahan: But, under a general, broadly liberal umbrella. So, you know, I think what he is…

156
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:06.969
Eugene Callahan: Essentially, in your terms, doing is saying, well, we can return to soft liberalism, and in fact.

157
00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.830
Eugene Callahan: There… he would contend there's no consensus

158
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:22.179
Eugene Callahan: for, for instance, re-Christianizing the U.S, that this would be very divisive, and it's… it's not going to happen given

159
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.820
Eugene Callahan: the,

160
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:34.789
Eugene Callahan: the large number of people who would object to the project. So, how would you respond to Gray's contention here?

161
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:43.690
Philip: Well, those… to my mind, they're two separate things. So, having different cultural and religious groups

162
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:56.719
Philip: live, in harmony, I suppose, has nothing to do with liberalism. It's happened before liberalism, it's happened since. I'm currently sitting in Budapest. I was down in Serbia a few weeks ago.

163
00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:03.910
Philip: We are close to the border here. There are minarets with the… with the crescent taken down all over the little towns here.

164
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:23.360
Philip: And what I'm saying there is that this region occasionally lived in harmony with various religious groups, and it occasionally lived in conflict with those religion groups, being the Ottoman Turk Muslims, and the various Christian denominations, from the Orthodox in Serbia to the Catholics and

165
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.009
Philip: Lutheran population, and…

166
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:35.189
Philip: in Hungary. Now, these people found a nice solution in the form of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, or previously the Austrian monarchy.

167
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:53.649
Philip: It was quite a stable situation, and although it is kind of controversial to say, after a few drinks, most people in the region will admit that the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was a pretty good way of running things. It was not a liberal entity at all, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. It was Catholic. It was quite Catholic, quite aggressively Catholic, but tolerant.

168
00:31:53.650 --> 00:32:01.509
Philip: tolerant. So I'll just give you an example of that. In Romania, I visited a Kolish forest, they call it here.

169
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:16.599
Philip: And, the town, basically, Kolishvar, which was Hungarian, still is partially Hungarian, went through a phase of… where a radical preacher came to town, I think it was in the 17th or 18th century, and he converted everyone to Protestantism.

170
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.050
Philip: think Lutheranism, it could have been Calvinism.

171
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:32.880
Philip: And the Habsburgs tolerated it. They, you know, gritted their teeth, and they tolerated it, and they didn't invade. And then he got new ideas into his head and converted everyone to Unitarianism.

172
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:41.269
Philip: And then they sent in the cavalry. And I think it's a great story. And then most of them are Catholic, but I actually had the privilege of

173
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:53.580
Philip: visiting a trad Unitarian village, which was full of Hungarians. It's the most fascinating place I've ever been in my life. But, this is… this is the history around here, and it has nothing to do with liberalism.

174
00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:17.819
Philip: And actually, I think that liberalism can often increase tensions between religious groups. I think they're… I think they're actually selling it in a very duplicitous way. I think, for example, the British liberal empire had a tendency to play groups off each other, to… to dominate liberal power. America's done a little bit of that as well, not quite as bad as the British have, but, so I think there's a lot of duplicity.

175
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:42.389
Philip: in that. So, we are going to have to figure out a way of living together, especially in Europe with our large Muslim populations. I think it's going to be very difficult. I think these ideas that we're going to re-migrate everyone are crazy. I think they'd lead to civil war. And I don't think that we're going to Christianize a bunch of, strongly believing Muslims who seem to believe in their faith more than the Christians on the continent. So, that's a,

176
00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:59.610
Philip: that's a separate… I think that is one question, one of religious toleration, and we are… I mean, that's just the world. The world's always just had to come to that conclusion. Before end times, does everybody become a Christian? That's above my pay grade, I don't know. But then the second question is.

177
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:16.739
Philip: can we re-Christianize the… how should I put it? I don't want to call them former Christians, because they're not former Christians. The current liberals, you know, progressive liberals, or whatever they are, they're kind of, they are still in that tradition. They're not Muslim.

178
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.479
Philip: They're a civilization of the same as…

179
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:35.489
Philip: actual practicing Christians' civilizational roots. So the question, really, for, I think, us, is what do we do with our own people, in a sense? I mean, the religious toleration question is very important, but it's a separate question from what we do with our own people.

180
00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:44.220
Philip: And I really don't see any alternative here. I mean, these people are either going to have to find their way back to some of their civilizational roots, or

181
00:34:44.219 --> 00:35:09.069
Philip: they're going… in fact, they already are, revert to barbarism. They are. It's very clear to me that they're going to revert… they already are reverting to barbarism, and I don't mean that just in an ethical sense, like, how dare they, you know, support abortion. Obviously, I don't like the fact they support abortion, but, you know, that's like the 90s version of this. No, I mean they will not be able to live properly. Like, they will not be able to take care of themselves, they will not be able to reproduce.

182
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:13.510
Philip: themselves as a species. They will put enormous burdens on our

183
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:33.570
Philip: social care systems and so on, and we're already seeing this. It's becoming really profound now in my generation, millennials and younger. I mean, the social norms have completely evaporated, and a lot of these people don't really know how to live properly, and it's only going to get worse and worse, and eventually you'll come to kind of like a…

184
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:37.220
Philip: I mean, I don't want to be offensive about it, but it really will be kind of…

185
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:48.469
Philip: people… people in bear skins, but in a digital world, you know? And the people in the bear skins aren't going to be very productive or useful. They're going to be quite chaotic, we're already seeing that around the edges.

186
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:57.610
Philip: And they're not, you know, gonna… and they're gonna require a lot, especially if they don't want to reproduce and so on. So there… that's the real question to me. I think the…

187
00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:13.739
Philip: what the Muslims do with Turkey isn't really our business. Obviously, we have to live with it, and we have to live in a world with them and everything like that, and we should try and do that in harmony. We don't want conflicts. But really, our focus shall be on what do we do with the

188
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:19.640
Philip: previous, but they're not really previous, the Christians that have kind of been wrecked by liberalism.

189
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:37.840
Philip: And as I said, I think it's, you know, they had that old phrase in the 60s, socialism or barbarism in France. I think it is really re-Christianization or barbarism. I don't mean that they all have to go to church or anything like that, but they have to start adhering to the… to the sorts of, moral values that say,

190
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.110
Philip: a slightly agnostic person in America in 1955 adhered to.

191
00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.300
Eugene Callahan: Oh, whoa…

192
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:56.720
Eugene Callahan: Walker Percy in, Love in the Rooms is talking about his, girlfriend at the time, and he said she was,

193
00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.100
Eugene Callahan: a really good Christian who didn't believe in God.

194
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.469
Eugene Callahan: And he said, on the other hand, I believe in God, but I'm a very bad Christian.

195
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.929
Philip: It's very good, yeah.

196
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.240
Philip: We all know people like that.

197
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:13.170
Eugene Callahan: Yes, alright,

198
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:21.059
Eugene Callahan: when it comes to the military, this was very interesting. I, of course, had seen the case made that

199
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:29.179
Eugene Callahan: Liberalism, leads to imperialism that… and, you know, this was clear when,

200
00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:43.310
Eugene Callahan: America was gonna spread democracy throughout the Middle East, and, you know, was gonna produce little mini Americas all over the world. But what was interesting in your book was that you make a strong case

201
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:50.690
Eugene Callahan: but one that I'm not really capable of evaluating, that liberalism is making purely,

202
00:37:50.770 --> 00:38:07.229
Eugene Callahan: tactical errors. Not just strategic errors trying to spread liberalism everywhere, but tactical errors in, the way that liberal societies spend money on military equipment.

203
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:16.620
Eugene Callahan: So, where did, how did you, develop this thesis? Have you,

204
00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:31.140
Eugene Callahan: did you have military experience in your background? It's just, I hadn't seen this case before, and like I said, I think you made a strong case for this, but I'm just curious how you arrived at it.

205
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:49.930
Philip: Well, no, I have no military background. I'm an economist. I can claim to be that. I have no military background, and I am not one of these weapons hobbyist guys that you'll find. I kind of like firearms, but I had no interest. I couldn't…

206
00:38:49.930 --> 00:39:00.330
Philip: 5 years ago, I couldn't have told you what a tank, you know, which tank was which. I was not one of these… I know people like that, and often they're very knowledgeable, and I wasn't one of those people.

207
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:13.789
Philip: And it was, it was the war. It was the war in Ukraine. I was fascinated by what was going on. I was fascinated the moment it broke out, because everything that I knew

208
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:17.010
Philip: Was basically that we…

209
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:22.569
Philip: well, I hadn't thought about it. It's one of those times, you know, I… I… there's this great,

210
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.189
Philip: a phrase I always go back to, it's by,

211
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:38.960
Philip: Hubert Dreyfus, the Heidegger scholar, and he says, says in one of his lectures that, that anytime you use a door, you, you never think about it.

212
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:57.990
Philip: But when the doorknob doesn't work, you think about it, and in fact, you can panic. You can go, oh, am I stuck in the room, you know? And that's really striking. I've had that experience a couple of times. You know, intellectually, I've had that experience a couple of times in my life, and they're always the most revealing times in your life, in a sense.

213
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:09.519
Philip: And and that was the Ukraine war, because I realized that my assumption, which I'd never really thought about, was the assumption of everybody, actually, which was that, basically.

214
00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:18.859
Philip: well, NATO, or the United States, or whoever we want to say backed the Ukraine side in that war, was really big, economically.

215
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:32.399
Philip: And we kind of thought, you know, maybe China's getting a bit of an edge in technology, but certainly Russia's not getting an edge in terms of technology. Now, that wasn't all true, actually. Russia had, had advanced in missile development.

216
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:49.810
Philip: and in a few other spheres. But, you know, we thought, well, we're the big economies, and so therefore, you know, there's absolutely no chance that Russia, if we poured all this materiel into this very large and well-trained army in Ukraine.

217
00:40:50.160 --> 00:41:08.769
Philip: then they'll, you know, if they don't win, they'll, you know, grind it to a real stalemate, like a real one, where, like, it's just obvious within, like, a year that it's a real stalemate. And the Russians will start taking so many losses that they can't replace their weapons and so on. That all turned out to be completely false.

218
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:27.039
Philip: And the more I… I just got fascinated with it, I just spent… I was just watching it every day. I read enormous amounts about military strategy, I… I started reading about how you planned, you know, strike packages, and…

219
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.309
Philip: and all this kind of thing, and the conclusion I came to was.

220
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:38.859
Philip: that, the West had just run away with itself. It had become completely, enamored with technology.

221
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:55.650
Philip: And some of this was… well, it was… it was jewel. It was partly because the United States, as the hegemon, especially since the 1990s, but even in the Cold War, to a certain extent, set its military up like a… like a global policing operation.

222
00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:04.539
Philip: And in a global policing operation, relying on, like, the best optic on your rifle, or whatever, like, makes some sense.

223
00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:17.609
Philip: makes absolutely no sense in mechanized industrial warfare, obviously. And so I realized that was one thing, and that was… that was inherent in the nature of the unipolar, you know, quasi-imperial system, let's be honest.

224
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:41.830
Philip: But the other sense of it was, number one, a complete fetishization of progressive technology, technological development, which was… is definitively liberal. It's a real hallmark of liberalism. Right up to the idea that, you know, the stuff I was reading from, like, the RAND Corporation thought that within 10 years, we'd have robots fighting robots, and there'd be no…

225
00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.120
Philip: Human deaths and all this kind of stuff.

226
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.250
Philip: Stuff that's just really… Almost to my mind.

227
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:50.750
Philip: And,

228
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:59.750
Philip: And so there was these two things kind of working together, the kind of liberal, progressive view of technology, which is the liberal aspect of it.

229
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:18.310
Philip: and the slightly more contingent, you know, geopolitical set of circumstances that the United States and its NATO allies, mainly the United States, found itself in. And then the one thing that I don't write about too much in the book, I just did… there was no space, because the military chapter is so long already, is the nature of military procurement.

230
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:33.160
Philip: using a market or quasi-market-based system, as they do in the United States and the West, actually encourages, through the very high profit margins that they can make, these technologically advanced

231
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:53.299
Philip: products over commodified products, like, you know, just generic tanks, generic drones, and so on. These are more things that are in what you might say in manufacturing are low margin products. You produce more of them, and you get a low margin. Nobody really… if you're given the choice, no capitalist really wants a low margin. It's a lot of work.

232
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:59.489
Philip: For a little bit of profit, whereas the high margin ones, it's… it's less work for a lot more profit.

233
00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:11.430
Philip: And also, the other issue is the procurement becomes a complete nightmare in that kind of a system, because, like, you show some big laser weapon, and there's two of them, like, how do you price that?

234
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:30.210
Philip: it's much easier for me to price, say, 1,500 T-72 tanks have rolled off the production lines in Russia. Yeah, I can look at the inputs, the steel, blah blah blah. I know, basically, what the economics of that are. Then you show me the laser weapon, and I'm like, I don't know, I don't know who to price that.

235
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:48.670
Philip: So there's a lot of room for graft, in a sense, in that as well. So those kind of things came together. So what I ended up concluding was, basically, that the Soviet model of quantity over quality is the correct one, unusually, I suppose.

236
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:58.660
Philip: And that's not that surprising, because centrally planned economies don't work, we know that. But centrally planned economies work very well for some things.

237
00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:08.169
Philip: And for military production, mass military production, yeah, you want a centrally planned economy. To build the highway system in America, you want that centrally planned, actually.

238
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:20.760
Philip: The early Soviet Union, not to get off on too much of a tangent, but the early Soviet Union, from the Stalinist collectivist phase in the 1930s up until the 1960s, when the main,

239
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:37.890
Philip: products were infrastructure development, electricity infrastructure, road infrastructure, rail infrastructure, building housing for people. I'm not talking about the quality here, but up until the 60s, when they had to turn to consumer products, central planning worked.

240
00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:53.169
Philip: And, you know, that was well recognized in America. That's what scared people, and seduced some people, like the people around Kennedy, John Kenneth Galbraith, and so on. And you still see, I mean, as I said in Budapest, I walk around and I still see the Soviet-era stuff. It's quite well built.

241
00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:58.819
Philip: So, central planning has its place, and central planning is definitely not a liberal principle.

242
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:16.610
Philip: And it seems to me that militaries must be centrally planned, and the liberalization of the military that took place was always kind of there. It was always kind of there in the Western militaries after World War II, but it really ramped up in the 1990s.

243
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:25.840
Philip: And it's produced what we see today. Massively expensive weapons that are wiped out by extremely cheap weapons produced elsewhere, even in Iran.

244
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:36.959
Eugene Callahan: So, I am a recovering libertarian, and as such, have a number of libertarian friends.

245
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.419
Eugene Callahan: And, they would find this puzzling as a critique

246
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:48.249
Eugene Callahan: Of their version of liberalism, because they would say, well, of course.

247
00:46:48.300 --> 00:47:04.450
Eugene Callahan: government spending is quite different in private spending. Of course, it's plagued with ineffici, and these, you know, these public choice problems will arise. So I wonder to what extent… now.

248
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:15.919
Eugene Callahan: I don't know what they'd offer as an alternative here to the way, the U.S. does procurement, but they wouldn't see

249
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:27.940
Eugene Callahan: your critique as a critique of liberalism or markets. They would say, well, this is a critique of government spending, which of course has these problems, and that's why we want to minimize it.

250
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:49.859
Philip: Well, the first thing I'd say is it's a longer discussion, and we won't get into it, but markets are not liberalism, and liberalism is not markets. Markets have existed before liberalism, and they'll exist after it. Markets, to my mind, are very natural human relationships, and that's why they're the best at distributing consumer products, certainly.

251
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:58.399
Philip: I'm not sure if they're as good at distributing capital investment, having worked on Wall Street for 10 years, I've seen some a lot of close.

252
00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:22.279
Philip: But they are definitely very good at distributing consumer products, and I think they are… they're just natural law-based, entities. I think that you can find non-liberal thinkers talking about markets. The Salamanca School stands out as the most prominent. That's a post-Reformation, counter-Reformation, I should say, Catholic, I think they're Thomas, so maybe I'm wrong with that. Jesuits or something.

253
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:37.239
Philip: And, so markets are a separate bag to liberalism. I think where liberalism comes into the picture is the fetishization of markets, is the thinking, and this would be my criticism of the libertarian strain of liberalism.

254
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:47.610
Philip: that markets solve absolutely every problem. And at that point, they kind of become a fetishization, and they definitely become ideological at that point.

255
00:48:47.610 --> 00:49:10.109
Philip: As in, ever, you know, you're there with a hammer and everything looks like a nail. If you're there with a hammer and everything looks like a nail, you're in the space of ideology, to my mind. Like, you've left the realm of practical political thinking behind, and you're in the realm of ideology. And there's, you know, varying ideologies, but you're in the realm of liberal ideology when you're trying to apply market-based principles to absolutely everything.

256
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:21.840
Philip: And that's kind of how I think about it. Markets function very well in certain circumstances. They function somewhat poorly in others, and they don't function at all.

257
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:28.929
Philip: in others, and that a military is just one that they do not function at all. There is absolutely no way

258
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:42.000
Philip: to… that I can think of, I think I'm a reasonably confident economist. There is no way I can think of to come up with some market mechanism to put a price on military goods that may never be used.

259
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:53.299
Philip: I mean, that's ultimately what we're dealing with. It could be… let's imagine that you had a three cycles of military goods, maybe once every 10 years.

260
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:58.499
Philip: You get a new kind of wave of innovations. And you have no war in those 30 years.

261
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:04.509
Philip: how do you price these things? I mean, it's… it's… now, what I am saying is that the pricing of the

262
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.690
Philip: 1,500.

263
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:24.759
Philip: tanks is easier, but you price them on an input-output basis, and that's central planning. That's literally how you do central planning. That's how Gaul's plan used to do central planning in the Soviet Union. And as far as I understand it, that's effectively how the Russian and Chinese, for that matter, military-industrial complex works at the moment.

264
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:39.730
Philip: So no, it's not a criticism of markets. I'm an economist. I believe markets have a very large role to play in society, but the fetishization of markets, I think, is very damaging. And in the other direction, where the fetishization of markets is very damaging.

265
00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:48.789
Philip: is where they start to colonize human relationships. We're seeing that at the moment, so I… one of my favorite examples at the moment is… I said I used to work on Wall Street.

266
00:50:48.790 --> 00:51:12.680
Philip: private equity firms are now buying up en masse campgrounds in the United States, and they're, you know, monopolizing them, and the rent prices are going up, and you can go on Instagram or whatever, all the RV guys are complaining about it. And there's loads of instances of this, of private equity snapping up various parts of society that the money power markets

267
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:37.670
Philip: shouldn't be in. And that's really pernicious as well. So, so the fetishization of markets, I think, is really dangerous in both directions. It can go too deep into the social fabric to extract value. I wrote a piece for American Affairs recently calling that consumption deepening, as in when you have to kind of go into people's souls to extract more profit. And then… and then another more practical instance, like in the case of military

268
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:56.030
Philip: planning. So we just shouldn't fetishize markets, and we should try and disconnect them from liberalism. Markets are a very good way to spread liberal principles. They just work like that. But they're not in… that's not inherent in them. That's like saying social media is a really good way of spreading liberal principles. It is.

269
00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:05.550
Philip: But that doesn't mean social media is inherently liberal. You could create a non-liberal, social media. So I just don't think we should fetishize markets. I don't think we should fetishize anything.

270
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.540
Eugene Callahan: Yep.

271
00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:12.180
Eugene Callahan: Very good. You talk about,

272
00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:26.359
Eugene Callahan: a large number of technologies developed by the state. Again, here I'm thinking… so I'm playing devil's advocate and playing libertarian, responding to you here.

273
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:40.420
Eugene Callahan: If we consider Toyota, 3M, Bellab, Xerox, Park, and we could throw on more examples. There are also lots of… lots and lots of new technologies developed outside the state.

274
00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:59.940
Eugene Callahan: Famously, you know, the internet started as a DARPA project, but a lot of the technologies enabling the internet were developed. Bell Labs did a lot of that, right? So a libertarian response there is likely to run… well, yes, given the

275
00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:13.390
Eugene Callahan: amount of government taxation and spending. Of course, there's a number of technologies that were… happened to be developed by the government, but if they hadn't been sucking up these resources, think how much more

276
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:23.339
Eugene Callahan: These private companies would have developed. They developed a lot as it is, and they, without all this taxation, they would have developed even more.

277
00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.020
Eugene Callahan: So how would you respond to a critic like that?

278
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:43.260
Philip: Well, they can't prove it. The thing is, like, the… even if I don't believe that stuff, I… I don't think that markets solve all the problems, and I think the state does have a role to play in the economy. But even if I didn't think that.

279
00:53:43.260 --> 00:54:06.669
Philip: the state's never gonna go away. This is, like, this is… this is the liberal anti-hierarchical utopianism. Like, even if you accept all the libertarian principles, if in the best case scenario the state went away and it disappeared and etc, etc, we'd be in a better society, like… yeah, but it's never gonna go away, because the state is a natural formation in human relationships.

280
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:14.569
Philip: And so all you're actually going to get is a better or worse state. And you can try and infuse that state with market principles.

281
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:30.510
Philip: might not work out so well, because it's not a market-based system, and it'll just exercise its kind of fiat and monopoly power. You might make the situation even worse than in the interventionist state. You know, it's not… even from a libertarian economics point of view, it's actually pretty hard to think through those kind of problems.

282
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:55.440
Philip: My advice would be do not try and inject too much market principles into the state. I've never really seen it work very well. But I just don't think the state is going away. I think those arguments are kind of like, you know, you know, you read Rousseau on the Noble Savage. I think it's of the same ilk. It's like, my response to Rousseau, obviously the Noble Savage isn't real from an anthropological point of view, but I don't think you even need to say that. I think I could go back to the 18th

283
00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:06.130
Philip: century, I'm pretty sure people did say this to him, and just say, like, there is no such thing as a noble savage, because, like, there is always a society. The person is always born into that.

284
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:16.530
Philip: And so it's a kind of… it's a kind of moot point. I see the same thing with the state. Now, that… that doesn't mean that you have to have a large state or a small state.

285
00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:28.249
Philip: I mean, just take the example today of the Chinese state versus, say, the British state, right? The British state, since the Thatcher era, has tried to inject as much in terms of market principles

286
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:52.669
Philip: They call it neoliberal principles, or whatever, into that state. It's tried to have all these public-private partnerships, all of these things. It brands itself as a kind of a market state, and you could say something similar for the German state, except the Germans are actually more competent at doing it. The British state's enormous. It's one of the largest as a share of GDP in the world, not quite as big as the French, but it must be 45%

287
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:58.510
Philip: of British GDP is in the British state. Meanwhile, look at the Chinese state. It's much smaller.

288
00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:06.990
Philip: It's only about 30%, I think, of GDP, much lower taxes in China and so on, very noticeable if you go there. But the Chinese state

289
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:31.929
Philip: is not neoliberal. It says we intervene in the economy really directly. It intervenes in capital formation. It controls… it controls the banking sector, not just at the Federal Reserve interest rate setting level. It does credit rationing in the banking sector through the People's Bank of China and so on. It is a real, what they used to call, dear regime state in the French parlance. And yet, look at that. The Chinese state is substantially

290
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:50.929
Philip: smaller than the British state. And when I ask people in China, like, oh, do you guys want to grow the state? They go, like, why would we want to grow the state? We'll grow the state if we need more state, but we don't want to grow the state for the sake of growing the state. Like, they think that question's odd. They think that's an unusual question to ask.

291
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.700
Philip: And yet, if you ask a Fabian socialist.

292
00:56:53.700 --> 00:57:01.350
Philip: in the Labour Party, well, do you think we should grow the state? Oh, yes, we should grow the state. It's such an unusual way of thinking about things.

293
00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:18.709
Philip: So I don't think that the… I don't think that the nature of a state has anything to do with the size of a state. I personally think you're better off with probably about, you know, 30% of GDP as the state. It's pretty much the same in Hungary, I think it's 35% here. Pretty small state. Again, enormous irony, because most people

294
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:37.280
Philip: Hungary is some autocracy that's ruled over by, you know, some sort of a King Orban or something like that. The state's much smaller here. The income tax rate is 15%. So, and yet, at the same time, I think that the Hungarian state bills itself as a more interventionist state than the British state.

295
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:54.159
Philip: In terms of intervening in certain markets. So I don't think the nature of the state is the same as the size of the state, and I… in response to what would it look like without the state, I think you were… that's noble, savage thinking, because I think states are inherent in human society.

296
00:57:54.430 --> 00:58:04.699
Eugene Callahan: Let's, finish up, reading your book. I was, occasionally thinking of Renee Girard.

297
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:08.650
Eugene Callahan: And your recent comments

298
00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:17.849
Eugene Callahan: bring us… bring that thought back to mind. In particular, He discusses,

299
00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:26.689
Eugene Callahan: he does an analysis of Troilus and Cressida, and ulysses gives a speech where he says, now that,

300
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:39.910
Eugene Callahan: hierarchies are overthrown, basically. I'm quoting from memory, so this isn't word for word, but now, you know, everything's chaotic. And what Girard shows, I think.

301
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:41.809
Eugene Callahan: Is that the attempt

302
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:53.199
Eugene Callahan: to overturn hierarchies does not result in an egalitarian society where everyone is equal. What it results in is a fierce struggle

303
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:54.739
Eugene Callahan: for a position.

304
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.699
Eugene Callahan: And, you know, we see that,

305
00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:17.319
Eugene Callahan: Musa Al Garbi analyzes wokeness as a struggle amongst elites to position themselves as the most woke, because this is prestigious, and if I'm woker than you, then I'm more deserving of an elite position.

306
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:23.700
Eugene Callahan: Are you familiar with Girard's work, and do you see it connecting to your own?

307
00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:31.460
Philip: Yeah, actually, this connection's really interesting, and I haven't said it yet to anybody.

308
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:48.639
Philip: But I kind of have a little bit of a joke, maybe to myself, maybe I've said it to somebody else, that the book… my account of liberalism is massively inspired by the work of Gilles Deleuze, the French post-structuralist philosopher, who wrote a book that's…

309
00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:52.820
Philip: both kind of brilliant and kind of awful, called Anti-Oedipus.

310
00:59:52.820 --> 01:00:05.489
Philip: I wouldn't really recommend reading it. I'm not sure why I read it, but I read it, and I said, this is the best account of the liberal mechanism I've ever read.

311
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:12.050
Philip: And where does it link up with Girard? Because both of them come from the French structuralist tradition.

312
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:26.820
Philip: They come from the tradition of French structuralist anthropology, basically started… well, started with Marcel Maus and so on, but really formulated by Levi Strauss, the philosopher. The anthropologist, I should say.

313
01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:39.140
Philip: And they think in those… in those exact terms, I think Gerard is often just putting many of these mythological structures, and I think he's explicit with this because he's an anthropologist, and he's putting them in this structuralist form.

314
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:56.859
Philip: And, what you… what… what Gilles Deleuz and his co-author, Felix Guaderie, are trying to say is that, you… they're kind of anarchists. I mean, they're just liberals in my mind, but, you know, they're the anarchist version of liberalism.

315
01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:19.729
Philip: And they want to tear down absolutely all the hierarchies. They're in that real 60s mold of, like, the Freudian vertical complexes in your head. Remember this Marcuse stuff from back in the 60s? Similar stuff, like, there's a policeman inside of all of our heads, and he must be stopped, and it's the father, it's the, you know, everyone's familiar with this in the kind of more watered-down version that came to the American shores.

316
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:30.120
Philip: But the, basically, the best actual articulation of this, the most philosophically coherent, was this Deleuze and Guaderie book. It's kind of fascinating in that regard.

317
01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.000
Philip: And what they're basically saying is, if you imagine

318
01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:48.519
Philip: if you imagine a society in terms of French… in terms of structuralist anthropology, you have all these social structures built up of customs and norms and totems and taboos, as they'd say, you know, basically moral structures, familial structures, all these kind of things.

319
01:01:48.520 --> 01:02:01.509
Philip: And Deleuze and Guadarri are saying, come in and smash it all, and then smash all the, like, representations you have of it in your own head, and you'll come out free. And what Gerard is saying is exactly the opposite.

320
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:08.780
Philip: He's saying that if you do that, you'll get absolute and utter chaos. And he's channeling that insight

321
01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:17.099
Philip: from the more classical authors, because he's… he's more of a classicist in that regard. And so he's exactly saying what I'm saying.

322
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:36.010
Philip: that if you actually try this tearing down of the hierarchies that liberalism promotes, in a sense, you will just get absolute chaos. And into that chaos, first we'll flow violence, as is in Girard, and then we'll form exactly what you've just said, a struggle for a new hierarchy.

323
01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:45.529
Philip: And a new hierarchy will just solidify. But this is what always happens with liberalism. Like today, right, I think we're currently at complete peak liberalism.

324
01:02:45.530 --> 01:03:02.000
Philip: Do we have a society of zero hierarchies? Are you kidding me? We live in an oligarchy. We live in the most obvious oligarchy I've ever seen. Who are these private equity guys going out and buying up your campground and telling you how much money you have to pay to park your RV and grill a chicken?

325
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:11.449
Philip: Like, these are oligarchs of the worst variety. So what happens is that when you smash all the good natural law-based hierarchies.

326
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:21.249
Philip: violence, then formation of arbitrary, really, I don't mean in the liberal sense, really arbitrary power-based hierarchies.

327
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:42.369
Philip: And okay, maybe the really nice guys will win out in your struggle for power. Very good chance they won't, and you'll just end up with this absolutely awful structure. But that awful structure will also be highly unstable, which is what we see today. Because it's a hierarchical structure that's, like, really overweening and oligarchic.

328
01:03:42.370 --> 01:04:02.460
Philip: it generates resentment, and it generates another cycle of kind of chaos. So, yeah, I mean, I'm not… I'm not a Girardian, per se, but it's definitely… a lot of the ideas of this came from the same kind of French structuralist tradition that Girard's from. From the other side of it, actually, the weirdo side of it in Paris.

329
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:10.019
Eugene Callahan: And it's fascinating that, anyone who challenges the oligarchy is anti-democratic, right?

330
01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:20.300
Eugene Callahan: That's… that's their defense. Any, any challenge to their power is, anti-democratic forces are growing in.

331
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:27.479
Philip: And if you see that, of course, they'll just say there's a policeman in your head that's tricked you into thinking about the wrong definition of

332
01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:50.710
Philip: That's exactly it, right? They start off in the 60s telling you that your father's superego is talking to you in your head, and then, like, one generational cycle later, it's like black is white. It's like Orwell 19… like, democracy is oligarchy, or men are women, or… like, that's how it goes, you know? You get… break down the normal.

333
01:04:50.710 --> 01:05:01.310
Philip: The normal familial psychology in a person, and then feed them the most weird, arbitrary, unnatural… hierarchies. It's fascinating.

334
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.970
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, I now have a private capitalist in my head instead of a policeman, right?

335
01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:11.430
Philip: a policeman as well, a woke FBI agent.

336
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:23.930
Eugene Callahan: Yes, there you go. All right, well, thanks so much for your time, it's been, great, and what I'll do, you know, we clean up, we'll stop the recording at this point.
