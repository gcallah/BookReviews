Holston declares that his approach is historical into senses, firstly, "in views this discussion regarding deliberation
itself as taking place over time" (2). Secondly, his approach is historical quote in the sense that it aims to bring to
bear on this conversation a sensitivity to the historical nature of deliberation in any society" (3).

Holston argues that Rousseau set himself in opposition to the materialism of Thomas Hobbes, and in particular, "the
sanction of the political doctrine that might makes right." (19)

Did Hobbes really hold that "might makes right"?  That seems a rather crude interpretation of what he was up to. Of
course the sovereign possesses might, but that is not what makes it right to obey him: it is rather that this might
enables him to call a truce in the war of all against all. If he used his might to, for instance, wipe out his own
subjects, Hobbes would certainly not claim that that makes it right.
