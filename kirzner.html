                Israel M. Kirzner is the dean of the "Austrian school" of
                economics. (I use scare quotes only because some, even some
                called "Austrian," dispute there is such a school, often
                contending that it has been absorbed into the mainstream.) Over
                six decades he has produced a stream of papers and books
                defending and extending the insights into the market process
                achieved by his mentors Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek.
