## Installing Python

Very detailed tutorial for different ways to install python in different operating system. Briefly but clearly states the benifit and limitation for each way of installation. The author also gives bash commands for installing python with pyenv like :

" $ git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer
  $ cd pyenv-installer
  $ bash pyenv-installer "

In conclusion, This book is new python user friendly, but the author also assumes the reader has fundimental bash/shell and git knowledges. 

## Packaging

Even this book's topic is DevOps in Python, it is packaging chapters are worth reading for people don't have special interest in DevOps. It is very helpful for setting up a valid, standard python envirenment for projects. Give a systemetic view and explaination on a lot of useful packages like virtural environment and Tox. As a student and developer who has been study from web blogs and stackoverflow for relative information, I think this book give me a better understanding of a lot of packages I am using now.

## Salt Stack

The author writes, "whenever a YAML file is used, `salt` will allow a Python file
that defines a dictionary." Does the author mean "whenever a YAML file is
*called for*, one may alternately use a Python file"? Perhaps... but then that
is what he ought to have written.
