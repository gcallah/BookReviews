                     Against the Grain:
                     A Deep History of the Earliest States
                </i>

                Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2017
            </h3>

            <p>
                James C. Scott gave two lectures at Harvard in 2011 on
                domestication and the earliest states. But the discussion
                afterwards, by a panel of experts, convinced him that his
                arguments "were not remotely ready for prime time" (x). So he
                plunged into five years of research on these topics, and the
                result is this work under review.
            </p>

            <p>
            "Extrinsic causes -- say, drought or climate change... -- may in
            fact be more important overall in state collapse, but intrinsic
            causes tell us more about the self-limiting aspects of early
            states. To this end, I speculate on three fault lines that are
            by-products of state formation itself. The first are the disease
            effects of the unprecedented concentrations of crops, people, and
            livestock together with their attendant parasites and pathogens...
            More insidious are two ecological effects of urbanism and intensive
            irrigated agriculture. The former resulted in steady deforestation
            of the upstream watershed of riverine states and subsequent
            siltation and floods. The latter resulted in well-documented
            salinization of the soil, lower yields, and eventual abandonment of
            arable land." (p. 31)
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of long-term impact on the environment,
                Scott notes that the harnessing
                of fire and its use over the last 400,000 to alter the
                landscape might "overwhelm crop and livestock domestication"
                (p. 38). In fact, Native Americans were such prolifigate users
                of fire that its "volume in North America was such that when it
                stopped abruptly, due to the devastating epidemic that came 
                with the Europeans, the newly unchecked growth of forest
                created the illusion among white settlers that North America
                was a virtually untouched, primeval forest" (p. 39). In fact,
                the cessation of the CO<sub>2</sub> output from such burning
                may have caused the Little Ice Age.

            <p>
                "Then, around 9,600 BCE, the cold snap broke and it became
                warmer and wetter again -- and fast. The average temperature
                may have increased as much as seven degrees Celsius within a
                single decade." (p. 43)
            </p>

            <p>
            Scott notes that states did not arise in wetland regions, and
            that is no accident: "wetland societies... were, and remained,
            environmentally resistant to centralization and control from above.
            They were based on what are now called 'common property resources'
            -- free-living plants, animals and aquatic creatures to which the
            entire community had access. There was no single dominant resource
            that could be monopolized or controlled from the center, let alone
            easily taxed... A state -- even a small protostate -- requires a
            subsistence environment that is far simpler that the wetland
            ecologies we have examined." (p. 57)
            </p>

            <p>
                Scott dismisses the belief that we can easily categorize people
                into a scale of "advancement" based on whether they were
                "hunter-gatherers, shifting cultivators, pastoralists" or
                settled farmers. Instead, evidence shows that peoples readily
                shifted among these ways of making a living, often combining
                them, or shifting from an "advanced" mode of living to a more
                "primitive" one when they found themselves in a new environment
                in which the "primitive" mode seemed more promising, as did the
                agriculturlists of Taiwan when they moved to the richer
                environment of Southeast Asia, and "reverted" to foraging and
                hunting. (p. 61)
            </p>

            <p>
                Why Plant at All?
            </p>

            <p>
                There is no magic point, Scott insists, at which
                hunter-gatherers suddenly become farmers. Instead, we have a
                continuum of landscape modifications which humans find to be to
                their advantage. Long before we domesticated grains, we were
                modifying environments so that they would produce more of the
                plants we liked. Deliberately planting a seed or tuber is "only
                one of hundreds of techniques designed to increase the
                productivity, density, and health of desirable but
                morphologically wild plants" (p. 70), including bruning
                undesirable plants, weeding, mulching, pruning, thinning,
                replanting, watering, and fertilizing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scott asserts that, in the process of domesticating grains,
                other plants, sheep, goats, dogs, cattle, horses, and poultry,
                we also domesticated ourselves. The humans in in the new
                environment Scott calls "the domus" had to devote themselves,
                to an unprecendeted degree, to the labor-intensive care of its
                co-inhabitants. In fact, it is not even clear who domesticated
                whom: most of our domesticates surely exist in far greater
                numbers than they would have without our attention. Perhaps
                they domesticated us to care for them?
            </p>

            <p>
            We often view the hunter-gatherer lifestyle as "primitive," and see
            the adoption of farming as an "advance" over it. But Scott
            notes that this conclusion is not obvious if we look at the
            cognitive skills necessary to cope in those different ways of life:
            </p>

            <p>
            "It is no exaggeration to say that hunting and foraging are, in
            terms of complexity, as different from cereal-grain farming as
            cereal-grain farming is, in turn, removed from repetitive work on a
            modern assembly line. Each step represents a substantial narrowing
            of focus and a simplification of tasks." (p. 90)
            </p>

            <p>
            In fact, hunter-gatherers had the whole toolkit of early
            agriculturalists (since they were harvesting wild grains), plus
            tools for collecting, trapping, hunting, building weirs, netting,
            and more.
            </p>

            <p>
            "The imperative of collecting people, settling them close to the
            core of power, holding them there, and having them produce a
            surplus in excess of their own needs animates much of early
            statecraft... The means by which a population is assembled and then
            made to produce a surplus... is less important... than the fact
            that it does produce a surplus available to non-producing elites."
            -- James C. Scott, <i>Against the Grain</i>, p. 151
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two problems I see in this passage:
            </p>

            <p>
            1) The "needs" of the people are regarded as a fixed amount of
            goods, and they have to be "made" to produce more. Now, undoubtedly
            taxes and other coercive measures might make people produce more
            than they otherwise would, but also they might have already been
            producing a "surplus" that attracted state formation in the first
            place. My point here is simply that there is no obvious criteria
            for what constitutes a surplus, other than "what the state can
            take," which, of course, is circular. Scott does later claim
            that evidence shows that pre-state people would not produce beyond "the
            locally prevailing standards of subsitence and comfort" (p. 152),
            but I see no reason to think this might not change with advances
            in technology.
            </p>

            <p>
            2) Scott seems to have a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy">physiocratic</a>
            view of the nature of production: people who produce food are
            productive, and others are "non-producers." But elites in most
            societies produce a variety of things, such as law, defense,
            ceremonies, monumental architecture, texts, and so on. Now, it is
            one thing to claim that "the people" would not have purchased such
            production, or at least as much of such production, on their own,
            but it is quite another to simply write it off as not production.
            </p>

            <p>
            "Each of the earliest states deployed its own unique mix of coerced
            labor, as we shall see, but it required a delicate balance between
            maximizing the state surplus on the one hand and the risk of
            provoking the mass flight of subjects on the other, especially when
            there was an open frontier." (pp. 152-153)
            </p>

            <p>
            "As with sedentism and the domestication of grain that also
            predated state formation, the early state elaborated and scaled up
            the institution of slavery as an essential means to maximize its
            productive population and the surplus it could appropriate." (p.
            155)
            </p>

            <p>
            Scott present a number of facts highlighting the importance of
            slaves in early states:<br />
            </p>

            <ul style="nested">
                <li>
                    "the most valuable cargo of Malay traders in insular Southeast
                    Asia were, until the late nineteenth century, slaves" (p. 156).
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Slaves represented a clear majority -- perhaps as much as
                    two-thirds -- of Athenian society" (p. 156).
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    "Imperial Rome... turned much of the Mediterranean basin into a
                    massive slave emporium... By one estimate, the Gallic Wars
                    yielded nearly a million new slaves..." (pp. 156-157).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                "A speculative note on domestication, drudgery, and slavery":
                many such passages!
            </p>

            <p>
            Scott disputes the usual formulation of the disappearance of early
            states as "collapses." He writes "it is... essential to emphasize
            what such events do not necessarily mean. They do not necessarily
            mean a decline in regional population. They do <i>not</i>
            necessarily mean a decline in human health, well-being, or
            nutrition, and, as we shall see, may represent an improvement.
            Finally, a 'collapse' at the center is less likely to mean the
            dissolution of a culture than its reformulation and
            decentralization." (p. 186)
            </p>

            <p>
            Why, then, the frequent narrative of collapses? Scott claims it is
            because "What in fact were lost were the beloved objects of
            classical archaeology: the concentrated ruins of the relatively
            rare centralized kingdoms, along with their written record and
            luxuries" (pp. 186-187).
