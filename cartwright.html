            <p>
                Cartwright: in fact, if we can't reason about singular causes,
                we can't reason about causes statistically.
                <br />
                Cartwright defends the notion of causation in singular cases
                against those who contend that only a statistical study on a
                large sample can produce robust evidence of causation. She
                holds that we can detect single causes much as we detect causes
                in a large study, as exhibitions of law-like regularities.
