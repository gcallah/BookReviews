## Principles objections

One objection to *The Principles* was "whether Berkeley is entitled to endorse
the Copernican theory, to which he has made reference in recent replies, if no
one has actually perceived the motion of the earth" -- p. 77

"Berkeley's reference to "what we should perceive" is not an account of possible
motions waiting to exist if we should relocate to the heavens, but merely a
reminder that the process by which we ultimately describe motion to an
unobservable earth still retains the idea of motion as observed, because it is
a consequence of the laws of motion, themselves generalized from observed
motion." -- Pg. 78

But I think Berkeley could have made an even strong point here: we *do*
see the motion of the earth, and in exactly the same way that we see the motion
of a ship that we are sailing on: we see that motion by seeing other things
moving relative to our "vehicle" (the ship or the earth). Here it may be
apropos to bring up a story of Elizabeth Anscombe's:

"He (Ludwig Wittgenstein) once asked me: 'Why do people say it is more logical
to think that the sun turns around the Earth than Earth rotating around its own
axis?' I answered: 'I think because it seems as if the sun turns around the
Earth.' 'Good,' he said, 'but how would it have been if it had seemed as if the
Earth rotates around its own axis then?'"
-- Anscombe, 1959, p. 151
