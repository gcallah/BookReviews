## Books

I have reviewed you a number of times. (Soul of the Marionette, Immortalization Commission)

The reason is that while I often have disagreed with you, I have never felt the things you said, I disagreed with were simply dumb or ignorant: instead, they were the logical conclusion of a presupposition with which I disagreed.

Short, every time I have read, or read and reviewed one of your books, I have never felt short changed, whatever I might reject of what you said. I'm so, when I saw you had published another book, which you do with alarming frequency, I would lineup to review you again.




## Style

Paragraph I sent

Compared to Milan Kundera

Neither Jesus nor Buddha "put together a coherent argument." And often neither did Plato! (Gadamer)

I thought maybe I'd just meditate on your book and throw out my thoughts: but probably not a publishable review!


## Hobbes

Why the focus?

In fact, if one were to be so bold and foolish as to offer a "central message" of the book, it might be that the circumstances that prompted Hobbes to write _Leviathan_ have again become salient in our time, as the liberal world order that prevailed for some years after the fall of the Soviet Union collapses around us.

## History

You claim that "While history is not the unfolding of reason, there can be logic in particular situations." (22) 

But he does not provide any argument for believing that a process that is non-rational should present us with "particular situations" that are amenable to logical analysis: how could such situations arise? How can we identify them?

The repeated rolling of dice is not "the unfolding of reason," but we would never suspect that certain sub-sequences would exhibit "logic."

Why wouldn't the (more?) consistent critic of Hegel say you just haven't gone far enough?


Let’s say I found a book the text of which seems to have been randomly generated. But here and there, I find a perfectly coherent page or two. I would find the existence of these sensible pages amidst this nonsense very puzzling, and hard to explain.



## Gaza


If the recent events in Gaza had occurred before you finished your recent book, would you have included a section discussing them? What would it have said?





## Evolution


Was the lack of teleology in evolution a discovery of modern science?

Newtonian physics did not *discover* that an object in motion tends to stay in motion: it presupposed this.

As an Oakeshottian, I understand every "special science" makes presuppositions: so no objection to Darwin's!


There was no tube of white paint in the dead artist's bag at the riverbank.


"The accidental origins of Christianity, of course, prove nothing. For a believer,
159 chance is the work of providence." (124) (This would be better stated as, "For the believer, what may appear to us as chance is actually the workings of an infinite mind.")


"Chance" is a matter of knowledge: Lottery balls tumbling around.

LaPlace's demon


"Evolution is natural selection among random mutations."

Are the different regimes that emerge in history really "random mutations"?




## Wokeness

Changing the name of the central branch of a GitHub repository from "master" to "main": boy, some kid in the project sure will appreciate that change!

"A step in the right direction."

It is actually a way to **distract** from the fact that one is doing nothing about our most serious problems.
