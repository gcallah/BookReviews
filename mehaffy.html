                     and the Roots of the New Urban 
                     Renaissance

            </h3>

            <p>
                I first encountered the work of the great urban theorist Jane
                Jacobs due to the influence of my friend and mentor Sanford
                Ikeda, who has devoted a great deal of his intellectual life to
                studying and expanding upon her ideas. Even earlier, 
                I had discovered the renegade architect -- and notably,
                "renegade" only because he was too respectful of traditional
                building styles and techniques! -- Christopher Alexander. I
                discovered Alexander while proceeding along a seemingly
                entirely unrelated path of enquiry: my study of software
                design. Oddly enough, while Alexander's work is often neglected
                in his own field, among software designers he is renowned for
                his development of the concept of "pattern languages." While
                Alexander applied the concept to buildings, neighborhoods, and
                cities, software "architects" were able to adapt it, with
                tremendous success, to software design. Due to my years spent
                as a software engineer, I was able to alert Ikeda to the
                resonances (?) between the work of Jacobs and Alexander, once
                he had introduced me to the former of the two.

            <p>
                Given this background history, I was quite intrigued when I ran
                across a book focused on showing how the ideas of
                Jacobs and Alexander might help 
                us in confronting and solving the problems due
                to the massive increase in urban population that has occurred
                over the last several decades, and that will continue for the
                foreseeable future. To understand how significant and rapid
                this change has been, we might consider that, according to
                Wikipedia,
                "At the turn of the 20th century, just 15% of the world
                population lived in cities. According to the UN, the year
                2007 witnessed the turning point when more than 50% of the
                world population were living in cities, for the first time in
                human history."
                (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization#History)
            </p>

            <p>
                But even as the number of people in cities waxed
                for economic reasons, in certain respects, the quality and
                sustainability of urban life seemed to be waning. In many
                cases, the population of "urban areas" increased even as city
                centers decayed: people migrated to car-dependent urban
                outskirts and suburbs. As Mehaffy notes, this migration not
                only devastated many cities, but it was also ecologically
                destructive, and largely dependent upon taxpayer subsidies, in
                the form of government-backed mortgages, government-built
                roads, and other taxpayer-funded goods such as sewer systems,
                schools, emergency services, and so on. What's more, many
                "urban renewal" projects, promoted to counter-act the effect on
                cities of this flight from the core, actually made matters
                worse
            </p>

            <p>
                Mehaffy, following in the footsteps of Alexander and Jacobs,
                recognizes that a great part of the blame for the woes created
                by 20th-century "rational" urban planning resulted from the 
                the planners pre-emptive dismissal of the notion that centuries
                of experience and a long record of survival should lend any
                credence to a way of structuring urban life. Instead, the key
                to successful urban organization was to have a "rational"
                theory of how cities should structured, and then to force the
                pattern dictated by that theory on urban residents, however
                reluctant they were to embrace it. Perhaps the apotheosis of
                this approach was the mid-20th-century destruction of many
                poor, but functioning, city neighborhoods, and their
                replacement by "rationally" designed housing projects, built
                according to some planner's theory. (Jacobs famously dismissed
                the typical result of these plans as "skyscrapers in a park.)
                The planners completely missed the intricate web of social
                connections that had existed in the "slums" they were
                destroying, since such a web was impossible to represent in
                their theoretical models.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Instead of recognizing that cities
                (and human social groupings in general) are instances of what
                Jacobs called "complex orders," the rationalist planners
                believed that 
                "The city itself would become a kind of machine for serving up
                whatever we needed or wanted" (p. 20).
                (A machine is an entity deliberately arranged to embody what
                Jacobs called a "simple order": for instance, to create a
                piston, the manufacturer purposefully crafts it so that 
                its structure allows the application of a simple mathematical
                equation as closely as possible, and excludes the influence of
                "random," unplanned factors to the extent the manufacturer can 
                isolate his machine from their forces.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite their supposed dedication to "scientific approaches" to
                understanding, the rationalist planners apparently never
                contemplated the fact that, if some form of organizing human
                life, or of structuring the built aspects of that life, has
                persisted across many, many centuries, then the 
                "null hypothesis" should be that such a persistent
                presence is evidence that that practice under examination
                is an important adaptation, which promotes
                the survival of the humans who embrace it.  My colleague
                Nassim Taleb calls this principle "the Lindy effect," named
                after the heuristic adopted by New York City
                actors hanging out at "Lindy's Famous Cheesecakes": if they
                wanted to predict how long a Broadway play would continue to
                run, but about which they had no knowledge but how long it had
                already been running, their best bet was to guess exactly as
                long as it had already run! Thus, a play that had run for a
                week would, most likely, close in another week. However, if it
                survived a month, then the right guess was that it would last
                another month. Once it had made it for a year, then predict it
                would run for one more year. This idea, Taleb contends, applies
                to any social phenomenon that does not have some biological
                constraint on its lifespan. (I.e., just because my aunt has
                lived to 100, does not mean I should predict she will live to
                200.) Contrary to our typical "modern" bias, if some social
                practice has continued for several thousand years, it will most
                probably persist for a couple of thousand more.  On the other
                hand, some recent, novel arrangement in social life,
                introduced, say, a decade ago, most likely has a shelf life of
                only a decade more. And Mehaffy does an excellent job of
                explaining how Alexander's "pattern language" of architectural
                design and Jacobs' extraordinary ability to recognize the 
                factors that make some city neighborhoods flourish and others
                decline can guide us towards policy choices most likely to
                create a better life for the ever more numerous inhabitants of
                the world's cities.
            </p>

            <p>
                So far, so good. But unfortunately,
                Mehaffy is not satisfied with simply sharing his genuinely 
                deep understanding of urban life, and his debt to Jacobs and
                Alexander as sources of that understanding. If he had been,
                I would have had nothing but praise for this book. Instead,
                he seems driven to make his understanding of cities
                appear connected to and compatible with the latest trends in
                intellectual fashion.  For instance, after noting
                that the ill-founded attempts of the rationalist urban planners
                were often grounded in understandings of the world modeled on 
                Newtonian science (the science of simple systems)
                or stochastic mechanics (the science of unordered systems),
                he writes: "Most people
                are now at least generally familiar with 'systems theory,' and
                with fractals, algorithms, strange attractors, network science,
                and the like" (35). This is an odd interloper in this book on
                cities: for instance, what are "algorithms" doing in there?
                "People" have been familiar with algorithms for over two
                thousand years: we still teach "Euclid's algorithm" and the
                "sieve of Eratosthenes" to computer science students today. 
                The leading founder of the "science of simple systems,"
                Isaac Newton himself,
                devised an algorithm for finding numeric roots. The existence
                of these and many other algorithms hardly stopped the butchery
                done on cities in the mid-20th century... so why are
                they relevant in this list? And some of the other items, such
                as fractals and strange attractors, while only recognized more
                recently, still appear more like trendy terms thrown in to make
                the practical knowledge of how to build livable cities more
                "scientific." People around the world, using traditional
                wisdom, built aesthetic and life-enhancing cities for
                centuries before they had ever heard of "fractals" or "strange
                attractors": I cannot help but wondering if Mehaffy is still in
                thrall to scientism, albeit a more hip version than
                "old-fashioned" Newtonian science.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, it is true that the increasing recognition,
                in scientific circles, of the existence of complex orders
                <i>can</i> represent a step forward. But if it is to do so,
                it is through warning scientists, and, more importantly,
                adherents of scientism, that these complex orders are
                <i>not</i> susceptible to theoretical mastery, but instead can
                only be (partially) tamed through experiential knowledge. 
                Wisdom in dealing with complex orders, in so far as it can be
                verbalized, will appear in the form of commonsense heuristics,
                rather than universal, theoretical propositions.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Those who fail to recognize this will often ridicule common
                aphorisms as "contradicting each other": e.g., "He who
                hesitates is lost" appears, to those who want to interpret is
                as a "theoretical principle," to contradict "look before you
                leap." But interpreted correctly as pragmatic considerations,
                both are true: sometimes, hasty action is disastrous, but so,
                sometimes, is vacillation. Understood as heuristics, the two
                aphorisms remind us that we must carefully weigh the cost of
                hesitation against that of a rash decision.
                As Eric Voegelin noted, "every attempt to construe the
                commonsense insights, which refer to the order of [our] entire
                existence, as scientific 'propositions' according to the model
                of the natural sciences, and find beyond them 'principles' that
                could take the place of the real source of order, is a
                violation against the structure of the realm of man"
                (<i>Anamnesis</i>, 211).
            </p>

            <p>
                We must now, unfortunately, turn our attention to the
                grimmest part of this work, which is Mehaffy's excursion into 
                "philosophy." Here he "butts heads" with both Plato
                and Aristotle, producing a spectacle much like watching
                a butterfly trying to "pummel" into submission
                a pair of elephants. In fact, I find it doubtful
                whether Mehaffy has even read much of
                either thinker; although they both have a single book appearing
                in the bibliography, neither book is actually cited in the
                text (as far as I could detect: I may have missed something).
            </p>

            <p>
                Mehaffy is contemptuous of Plato's work describing the
                transcendent "forms."
                Of course, as Collingwood noted, Greek thought had reached an
                impasse trying to sensibly connect the transcendent and the
                immanent, and it was only with the formulation of the idea
                of the trinity that the impasse was broken. Nevertheless,
                Plato <i>was</i> a great thinker, and deserves to met with
                arguments a little bit better than: "Going back to Plato, was
                the shape of a dorsal fin a timeless form, existing in some
                unseen realm? No, certainly not: it was a pattern that formed
                for comprehensible reasons..." (118).
            </p>

            <p>
                So, Mehaffy's "refutation" of Plato is... "no, certainly not"?
                And why the sneering at the notion of "some unseen realm"? Is
                he not aware that much of modern science has consisted in the
                revelation of one unseen realm after another? And does he
                really think that Plato thought the forms were
                <i>incomprehensible</i>, rather than the ultimate source of
                comprehensibility?
            </p>

            <p>
                Mehaffy continues, "So we can finally dispense with an
                external, transcendent realm of <i>Forms</i>,
                and shift our understanding to that patterns" (119).
                Why "finally"? Has Western Civilization been sick of these
                "<i>Forms</i>" for centuries, but just could not figure out how
                to rid itself of them, until Mehaffy came along? And
                apparently, all it took to rid ourselves of these louse-like 
                forms was "of course not"! If we had only known! But, in any
                case, thank goodness for Mehaffy, we can now jettison
                these annoying forms and replace them with... patterns.
                But consider that in <i>The Republic</i> Plato writes,
                "But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the
                likenesses of real existences modelled after their patterns..."
                In other words, for Plato, "forms" and "patterns" are
                synonyms... so Mehaffy has triumphantly replaced one of Plato's
                terms for transcendent existents with another of Plato's
                terms for them.
            </p>

            <p>
                But surely there must be more here than that? Since Mehaffy
                wants to boot transcendence out of respectable society, then
                where do these "patterns" have a home? His answer is that,
                "As far as we are concerned, ultimately these are 'only'
                abstractions within own our own brains" (119).
                Well, well... but how can an "abstraction," something
                distinctly non-material, exist in a concrete, flesh-and-blood
                brain? And if they only "exist in our brains," then of what use
                are they in explaining, say, dorsal fins? Don't worry, Mehaffy
                assures us, these patterns "are no less 'real' structures
                in the world" (119).
                If, "as far as we are concerned," these
                patterns "only" exist in our own brains, then for whom,
                exactly, are they "real structures in the world"?
                For Martians, for angels, for God?
                I'm sorry, but this is simply
                pseudo-philosophical double-talk, designed to impress the
                philosophically naive.  All of the chapters on "philosophy"
                could have been left out of this book, and the resulting tome
                would have been less dense in both senses of the word.
            </p>

            <p>
                As noted above, Mehaffy has certainly thought deeply about
                matters of urban design, and is clearly on target in his
                criticisms of much recent, sprawl encouraging development.
                Still, after a salutary review of the large environmental
                cost of the deliberately planned, "strip-mall and tract
                housing" suburban development that dominated post-WWII America,
                Mehaffy claims we need a new "operating system of growth" (152)
                It seems he wants to repair the problems produced by top-down
                attempts to engineer society with a new, better attempt to
                top-down engineer society. But he again hits the target when he
                notes that "the primary aim of architectural design today is,
                very simply, not to find the best possible solution for human
                environments, but rather, to create adventurous new sculptural

                Mehaffy is correct, in my view, to claim that the city should
                be organized for the good of all of its residents,
                and in noting that typically will be prosperous in proportion
                to how well they align with that ideal. But when he claims this
                is necessary "for justice," I have to wonder how, having
                rejected the idea of transcendent values as something
                old-fashioned and "Platonic," Mehaffy can invoke an ideal
                of "justice" as supporting the sort of city organization he
                (and I!) wish to see realized. If he wishes to ground his
                ideas about urban living on noting "interesting and
                useful structural relationships and isomorphic properties,
                without respect to any metaphysical or ontological assumptions"
                (111), then how in the world can the notion of "justice" insert
                itself? Entities like minerals, metal alloys, semiconductors, and
                drugs all have "interesting and useful structural relationships
                and isomorphic properties," but I have never encountered anyone
                who would term one particular alloy "just," and another
                "unjust." My point here is that, while Mehaffey's regard for
                the common good as an overriding concern in urban policy is
                laudatory, his reflexive (see "of course not!" above) dismissal
                of granting any reality to the transcendent renders his concern
                for the "justice" of social conditions without any anchor.
                After all, the Gulag certainly must have had "interesting and
                useful structural relationships," and slave-holding societies
                "isomorphic properties": so, without any "metaphysical or
                ontological assumptions," on what basis would Mehaffy condemn
                them? (And, please note, I'm sure he <i>would</i> do so: what I
                am pointing out is that, while Mehaffy's heart is in the right
                place, his "philosophy" surely is not.)

                Mehaffy has done his readers a great service in showing
                the harmony in the ideas of Jacobs and Alexander, and has
                many salutary suggestions on urban design. It is unfortunate
                that he was unable to resist entering philosophical
                discussions that are evidently over his head, but the ugly
                episode of that excursion does not render this book unworthy
                of an urbanist's attention. Just, for your own well being,
                skip over those chapters.
