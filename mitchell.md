Mark Mitchell has written a brief and interesting book arguing that the
widespread ownership of productive property is an essential support for
political liberty.
As he puts it: "The thesis of this book is simple: democracy without private
property is fundamentally unstable and will not survive." (14)
On this point, I wish Mitchell had addressed Plato's case that democracy, even
with private property, is fundamentally unstable.
(Or, to cite a more recent political theorist, the Nigerian musician and
activist, Fela Kuti, called democracy a "demonstration of crazy.")
Perhaps he has a good answer
to Plato and Kuti here, but if so, it is missing from this work.





In the introduction, Mitchell makes a curious distinction as to whether people
believe the most common future form of government would be "democratic" or
"socialist." (p. 1) This ignores the fact that there is almost certainly a
great overlap between the two beliefs. Now perhaps Mitchell holds with Hayek
that in the long run democratic socialism is unstable and will cease to be
either democratic or socialist, and perhaps that view is correct, but this is
an opinion poll, and if people think future governments will be both democratic
and socialist, well, that is what they think.


Mitchell spends a good amount of the book discussing the history of attitudes
towards private property beginning with the Bible, continuing with Plato,
Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, the American founders, Tocqueville, Marx, Ropke, and
more. He makes it clear that many people have supported the idea of private
property, for many reasons. This material is interesting, but I can't help
feeling that Mitchell would have been better off writing two books: one a pure
history of the idea of property, and the other his argument for the widespread
ownership of productive property, which would use historical material only to
buttress his case.



Mitchell quotes Mises: "if workers... 'changed their locations and occupations
according to the requirements of the labor market, they could eventually find
work.'" (86)

This quote offers an extremely important insight into the libertarian view of
the human being: A person is a capital good, and as such, should be available
to be picked up and moved anywhere in the world that capital needs him to be.
The fact that this person might have family, friends, a church, and a community
in a place that they feel affection for are, in this view, all simply barriers
to higher productivity. All of those things can be replaced by a bigger
flatscreen TV and a nice new leather recliner.

One problem with this book is that I find myself agreeing with many of
Mitchell's suggestions, but simultaneously thinking "this does not have a
snowball's chance in hell of going anywhere." For example, consider his
suggestion that, to encourage entrepreneurship, "Excessive regulations that
create barriers to entry should be eliminated" (137). Yes, they should be, but
under the current regime, they are not going to be. Should some law maker
propose a measure that would truly lower barriers to entry, The proposal would
be denounced as allowing businesses to trash the environment, evade taxes, and
exploit workers. The mere fact that Mitchell's suggestion is a good idea will
not protect it the storm of propaganda that attempting to implement it would
invoke.

Consider something as obviously harmful as our nation's subsidizing huge
mono-crop fields of corn and soybeans: the environmental destruction of the
soil and the water (from chemical runoff from the fields) is vast, it makes
our farm economy vastly less diverse, it increases the risk of economic
catastrophe should a disease strike either crop, and the benefits accrue
mostly to wealthier farmers. But there is no significant movement to get rid of
them. How much less chance would a much more easily attacked bill like one
dropping business regulations have?
