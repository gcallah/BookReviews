Philip Pilkington has written a very provocative and thought-provoking book, one that deserves to be taken seriously by
anyone interested in the future of currently liberal polities. (Note: throughout the book and this review, "liberal" is
being used as philosophers and political scientists use it -- see PP's definition below -- and not in the sense it is
often used in American political discourse, in which it means "somewhat left of center.")

And, quite naturally, he first turns his attention to the question of just what is this thing that is collapsing. And
his answer is: "We will consider liberalism to be the Enlightenment political ideology par excellence that sought to level
and 'rationalize' social and political relationships. Liberalism's target has always been hierarchical structures in
politics and society at large." (10) Of course, many alternative definitions are possible, and definitions, per
definition, cannot be wrong, only more or less informative. But in this case, I think PP has provided us with an
extremely informative definition.

## Liberalism's Collapse

One aspect of PP's work that leaves me uneasy is his confidence that global liberalism is collapsing rapidly and that
the immediate future will be "post-liberal." While I agree with his contention that liberalism is an inherently unstable
way of organizing a polity, and that liberal societies are already demonstrating this truth, I am not so sure about his
timeline.

After all, let us consider progress of the Roman polity: by the late second-century B.C., with the rise of populism led
by the Gracchi brothers, and the brothers subsequent assasinations. Civil wars and various dictatorships followed, and yet, in
the West, the polity survived more than another five centuries, while in the East it limped along until 1453 A.D. (The
residents of what we today call "The Byzantine Empire" self-identified as Romans and understood the political unit in
which they lived to be the Roman empire.)

So, given that we know a polity can be in decline for a very long time, from whence comes PP's confidence that the
demise of liberalism is nigh? I do not deny that he could well be correct, but I can also envision a plausible future in
which the death throes of liberalism extend over quite a long time.

One aspect of liberalism is its rationalism, in the pejorative sense of the word as it was used by 
[Michael Oakeshott](https://fee.org/articles/michael-oakeshott-on-rationalism-in-politics/),
among others. Indeed, liberalism's opposition to heirarchy and involuntary relationships is that it deems them
"irrational." However, in his understandable desire to discredit forced rationalist revamping of customary practices, PP
makes a claim I think is mistaken, when he criticizes the French revolutionaries attempt to establish decimal
timekeeping by claiming: "the 24-hour day and the calendar that grows out of it are based on lived reality of night and
day as it occurs on earth"
(36).

The correct argument against the 10-hour clock is that the French revolutionaries had been hypnotized by the fact that
they counted in base-10 into thinking that measuring everything in multiples of ten was somehow more rational than
any other multipler, such as 12 or 24. And therefore there was no reason to do away with dividing the day into 24 hours:
no division is more rational than any other, and so it is more sensible to use the conventional divisor, and not disrupt
everyone's time keeping to switch to a different, and equally arbitrary, divisor.

Certainly, our lived reality tells us that some part of each day is dark, and some part is light. 
But nothing about our lived reality demands that we divide each day into 24 hours. In Japan, for instance, the day and
the night were each divided into six "hours." In Muslim countries, the main divisions of the day are the times of the
five daily prayers. In ancient India, the day was divided into eigth *prahars*. And in medieval Europe, monasteries
divided the day by the eight times of prayer: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. These
traditional divisions were, in fact, more in tune with our lived reality, as they typically varied these divisions as
the daylight period grew shorter or longer. It was only with the widespread usage of mechanical clocks that the idea of
dividing the day into 24 equal periods became common: that division was itself a fitting of our lived experience into the
requirements of a machine.

PP also makes a questionable claim about classical metaphysics:
"There are many variants of the classic metaphysic, from Platonism to Aristotelianism and everything
in between" (30). But R.G. Collingwood, Lloyd Gerson, Eric Voegelin and other have argued that Aristotle in fact only
represented a slight shift from Plato's views, giving somewhat more emphasis to immanence than to transcendence. The
ancient world contained a much wider variety of metaphysical thought, such as the materialism of Democritus and
Lucretius or the work of the pre-Socratics such as Thales, Anaximander, Parmenides and Zeno, to say nothing of Eastern
metaphysics.


## Military

PP devotes an entire chapter to the mistakes liberal governments have been making in military strategy. Now this is an
area in which I have no expertise, and so I am in no position to critique PP's case on this front. But I can describe
it: liberal governments are bewitched by their belief in progress (so that later tech must always beat earlier tech),
and their conviction that the price of something reflects its utility (so that a $100 million weapon must be better than
90 million dollar weapons).
And thus they have spent way too much on very high-tech equipment and far too little on building up large quantities of
cheaper but still effective materiel. As an example of the strategic mis-steps possible due to this liberal bias, he
cites the case of the Lancet drone, which costs around $35,000, but is very effective at taking out $11 million Leopard
tanks. PP estimates that, once we take into account purchasing power parity (a technical macroeconomic concept we
needn't dwell on here), "For every Leopard II tank Germany can produce, Russia can produce 683 Lancet drones." (109)

PP makes a quite plausible case that the liberal nation's military strategy is flawed for the reasons he describes, but,
again, this topic is so far out of any domain in which I have any expertise that I am no position to evaluate his claim.
However, he notes that, contra the liberal faith that higher prices mean commensurably higher quality, "the market for
military equipment is very likely not competitive." (121)

But this notable difference between government spending on the military and private spending is not something that would
surprise any libertarian or public choice theorist. So is this really a case where liberal ideology leads people astray?

Pilkington contends that in the case of technological advances, "The technologies themselves were developed by the
state..."

It is true that, for instance, the Internet began as a DARPA project. But what about the myriad of technologies
developed by private companies, such as those coming from Toyota, 3M, Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC, just to name a few.
A free-marketer might well respond to Pilkington, "Think how much more the private sector might've developed if so
much R&D energy wasn't diverted to government use?"

Pilkington may have a good answer to this question, but he skirts over this issue too lightly in his book.



## Demographic

Pilkington notes that once liberalism thoroughly infects a society, that society's birth rate begins to plummet, always
to below replacement rate. This fact can hardly be disputed, since it has held without exception. Thus liberals are
faced with the awkward fact that liberal societies universally commit demographic suicide.

The response on the part of most liberal nations has been to import people to make up for the deficit in native births.
But, as Pilkington points out, this solution both ignores the societal strains of incorporating large numbers of
immigrants who are not familiar with their new culture, and runs in contradiction to liberal imperialism: once liberal
values are exported to all nations, as is the liberal dream, than there will no longer be nations with above-replacement
birth rates from which to import people.

A minor quibble here is that Pilkington repeatedly uses the phrase "rate of people" instead of the more usual "birth
rate": I cannot see any reason for this change of terminology, nor does he offer one.


Sexual consumerism

Stupid idea: "sex is a purely private affair"

Raising awareness of STDs: word magic!



## Macroeconomic

When it comes to international trade, Pilkington interestingly revives a proposal by John Maynard Keynes for using a
planned system involving a notional trade currency called the "bancor" and a schedule of remedies for persistent trade
surpluses such as forced investment by the nation running a surplus in the nation experiencing the deficit.

Pilkington, unfortunately, does not present any argument as to why persistent trade deficits are worrisome. The standard
response from advocates of free trade to such worries is to present an analogy where I, a computer programmer,
habitually run a "trade deficit" with my local grocer: I regularly buy his groceries, but he never purchases any of my
software. And the point of the free trade case here is there is no cause for me to worry about this situation. Of
course, there may be reasons why scale matters here, and that my trade deficit with the grocer is a flawed analogy with
one nation's trade deficit with another, but Pilkington does not provide such reasons.



## Societal Bonds



## Neo-Paganism




## Conclusion

PP concludes his book first by declaring the importance of teleology for post-liberal thought. By this he means that
post-liberals should recognize that the participants in the world have ends that are inherent in their nature: a common
example is that an acorn has the natural end of becoming an oak tree. And so to do individual human beings and human
families and polities. These ends are not a matter of choice or "individual preferences": they spring from the very
nature of these entities. The family, for instance, has the natural end of bearing and rearing the next generation of
human beings. Recognizing this reality can guide post-liberal policies. For example, PP writes:

"A society that is organized against human nature will be a chaotic and unhappy society – it pushed too far against its
nature, it will collapse. A society that organizes itself in line with human nature will never be perfect, but it will
be more optimal in a society that is not organized in such a way." 218

And that all strikes me as correct. However, PP seems to me overly sanguine when he follows the above by declaring that
"Such a society will be stable, prosperous, and its inhabitants will be content and happy."
Was it not a society that was teleologically oriented (that of Medieval Christendom) that gave birth to the unstable and 
discontented society we live in today? Indeed, weren't Adam and Eve living in line with their natural ends when the
serpent slithered into the garden? And yet nevertheless they ate the apple. PP seems to missing the sense of the tragic
aspect of human existence that led someone like Plato to note that even if we could establish the perfect city, soon
enough human nature would lead to its fall from Eden.

PP then outlines a list of his recommended policies in many of the areas contemplated earlier in the book.
