            </h3>

            <p>
            John H. McWhorter is a linguist at Columbia University, and a
            fascinating and sometimes controversial figure. For instance,
            although he describes himself as "a cranky liberal Democrat,"
            he also wrote a book,
            <a
                href="https://fee.org/articles/losing-the-race-self-sabotage-in-black-america-by-john-h-mcwhorter/"><i>Losing
                    the Race</i></a>, which claims that African-American
            culture is partly to blame for the relatively poor performance of
            African-Americans in school and work life. That book made him
            popular with conservatives, and led The Manhattan Institute to name
            him a contributing editor to its publication <i>City Journal</i>.
            On the other hand, he is a vigorous defender of "Black English" as
            a perfectly valid form of English, just as grammatical as
            "standard" American English. (That is a position that
            traditionalist conservatives <i>ought</i> to embrace, first of all
            because it is correct, and secondly because it recognizes the
            priority of concrete ways of life over abstract rules. But alas,
            too many conservatives have mistaken the position of 19th-century
            grammar rationalists as being conservative.)

            <p>
            In addition to these positions that have brought him into the
            public eye, McWhorter is a serious linguist, specializing in
            language change and Creole languages, and conversant in 
            Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch,
            Swedish and Hebrew. (Source:

            In <i>The Language Hoax</i>, McWhorter takes on an important and
            contentious view that has been kicking around linguistics and the
            social sciences since at least the 18th century, a theory which has
            sometimes been called the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis" (itself a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">controversial
                term</a>). The essence of this view is that the worldview of we
            humans is... well, here things get murky: determined by? strong;y
            influenced by? somewhat influenced by?... the language we speak.
            </p>

            <p>
            Evaluating the case for and the case against "Whorfianism" (the
            term McWhorter prefers to "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis") is confounded
            by the fact that various proponents and opponents of Whorfianism
            have used their support or opposition in all sorts of polemical and
            politically charged ways. For instance, in the early 19th-century, 
            Wilhelm von Humboldt argued that "inflectional" languages, those
            with lots of prefixes and suffixes that modify a word's grammatical
            role, are superior to other langauges, and that is why their
            speakers have come to dominate the world
            (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity#German_Romantic_philosophers).
            But that idea cannot survive even moderate scrutiny: English is far
            less inflected than German or Italian, so why is so much more
            of the world Anglophone rather than Germanophone or Italophone?
            And since some of the worlds most inflected languages were spoken
            by Native Americans, why didn't the groups that spoke those
            languages wind up dominating the globe?
            </p>

            <p>
            McWhorter commits a serious error in assigning the cause of this
            bewildering variety in human language. He writes, "In
            fact, there is a coherent explanation... That explanation is, quite
            simply, chance" (43). This is nonsense, albeit common nonsense.
            "Chance" is not an explanation for anything: chance is the word we
            use for happenings we <i>can't</i> explain. In cases such as
            the presence of evidential markers in the Tuyuca language,
            McWhorter is fighting against the Whorfian view that there is
            always a <i>macro-level</i>, cultural/environmental explanation
            for the features of a language. And he makes a strong case,
            throughout the book, that that is not so.  
            </p>

            <p>
            But there is
            certainly <i>some</i> explanation for how they arose: perhaps a
            long-lived chief was an especially suspicious fellow, and some
            little tic led him to put small sounds of doubt at the end of
            otherwise factual statements when he questioned their factualness.
            Now, this would be a fact of history that is long lost, and that we
            probably have no hope of ever recovering. And to that extent, 
            McWhorter would be accurate if he had said, "It might as well have
            been the flip of a coin." But, of course, coin flips are not chance 
            events! Or, rather, saying they are a chance event is an expression
            of our ignorance of, and, indeed, despair at ever detecting, what
            really caused a coin to come up heads or tails on some particular
            flip.
            </p>

            <p>
            Consider the opening toss before a football game, which determines
            who kicks off. These events are governed by "chance" from the point 
            of view of the players and referees involved. But whether the coin
            comes up heads or tails is, in fact, determined by the force and
            angle of the refs flip, the air resistance, the gusts of wind that
            impact it, the participants' movements, and more. If anyone
            involved could exactly determine the impact of all of those
            factors and could rapidly calculate with them, he could say for
            sure whether the coin would land on heads or tails. It is their
            inability to do such calculations that makes the coin flip, from
            their point of view, chance, and a fair way to decide who kicks
            off. But it is certainly not an explanation for why the coin landed
            as it did: it is the admission that the participants <i>can't</i>
            explain it.
            </p>

            <p>
            McWhorter goes on to, about what he see as the chance nature of
            these languages changes, "There is a comfort in this reality" (43).
            Well, as Rocky Rococo would say, "Maybe yes, maybe no." But in
            either case, so what? Are we now weighting the degree of comfort
            scientific theories provide in our evaluations of them? Should we
            give a couple of points to Ptolemy vis-a-vis Copernicus of people 
            are more comfortable with a stationary earth? He brings similar,
            one would think irrelevant, considerations into play a bit later,
            when he writes, "Whorfianism, here, seems dangerous" (78) (in
            making the Chinese speakers seem less clear-headed than English
            ones). But if Whorfianism is <i>true</i>, than even if it is
            "dangerous" in the way McWhorter suggests, well...? What? We should
            surpress it? I thought scientists were proud iconclasts, who
            followed their theories however many idols were crushed along the
            way?

            IQ: "Respondendents tended to find the very idea of answering
            questions disconnected from real-world utility idle, boring,
            and even faintly ridiculous" (83).
