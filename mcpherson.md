# The Virtues of Limits


David McPherson 
Oxford University Press 
2022


In an age which glorifies going beyond limits, McPherson highlights the importance of "recognizing proper limits in
human life." He focuses on the "limiting virtues" of "humility, reverence, moderation, contentment, neighborliness, and
loyalty." He discusses these virtues in relation to four kinds of limits: "(1) existential limits; (2) moral limits; (3)
political limits; and (4) economic limits." (1) McP calls the approach to life that acknowledges such limits as the
"accepting-appreciating stance," and that which seeks to oversome limits the "choosing-controlling stance." Throughout
the book, he stresses that both stances are essential aspects of human life, but that the accepting-appreciating stance
should be our default attitude. Making the choosing-controlling stance primary drains life of meaning, since the world
is seen as a collection of problems to be solved, the solving of which, in the absence of acceptance and appreciation,
soon enough appear pointless. As McP puts it, the dominance of the choosing-controlling stance leads to nihilism.

## Existential Limits

McPherson begins his anaylsis of these virtues by arguing
that the master limiting virtue is humility, because it reigns in our tendency to "play God," a tendency McP also
calls "the Promethean spirit." As one prominent example of that spirit, McP cites Nietzsche and the murder of God, leaving
us in a situation in which "We must play God," and transcend humanity by becoming "ubermensch." Nietzsche's epigones
today call themselves "transhumanists," and hope to leave behind the human condition not, like Nietzsche, through the
will, but largely through medical and technological sorcery.

McP takes on notable legal theorist Ronald Dworkin's embrace of genetic engineering, in that it treats children as
manufactured products from which all defects are to be removed, rather than as gifts to be accepted.

Given the many quotes from G.K. Chesterton in this book, 
McP is clearly an admirer him; here he quotes him on the foolishness of piling up more and more stuff without
appreciating what one already has: "there is no sense in not appreciating things; and there is no sense in having more
of them if you have less appreciation of them." 37

The ultimate rejection of the accepting-appreciating stance is suicide, and here McP again turns to Chesterton for
insight:

"Not only is suicide, a sin, it is the same. It is the ultimate and absolute evil.. the refusal to take the oath of
loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he's
concerned, he wipes out the world...

## Moral Limits

48: Interestingly, McPherson turns to the Confucian tradition when he wants to discuss reverence.

52: Citing the work of Sarah Buss, McPherson argues that good manners help to form a virtuous character, by inculcating a proper sense of respect for others.



60: Aristotle on how we must control our animal appetites

61: basic table manners are a way of taming and controlling our animal appetite for food and humanizing it

The person who said Asians slurp their soup because their cultures are "more relaxed."


62: similarly, in regards to sex, we transform lust into romantic love.


64:
McPherson argues that the best case for respecting absolute limits on what we may do, such as killing innocent people
being forbidden, rests on reverence. And he shows the flaws in several other approaches to defending these absolute
prohibitions, such as Stuart Hampshire's contention that they avoid "moral anarchy."


McP next turns to the proper role of partiality in the moral life. (71) Those entranced, with rationalist, moral
theories, often reject the idea that we should view our own children, or our next-door neighbor, with any higher
regard than a person in need, whom we have never met, on the other side of the world: such attachment to our own is
"irrational," they contend. John Stuart Mill and Peter Singer are cited as prominent examples of this view.
McP does an excellent job of destroying such nonsense: abjuring special concern for
one's own family, friends, and neighbors in favor of "humanity," is typically a mask hiding the fact that the person
recommending this really doesn't care for anyone else at all.

Ordo amoris


75: the more I love humanity in general the less I love particular people


78: Aristotle: "Those who are many-friended, and treat everyone they meet as if they were their own kin, seem to be friends with no one."

81: Gilbert Meilaender: "We did not create ourselves; we simply find ourselves here..."





McPherson does not seem to give quite enough weight to the limit limits on loyalty. He considers a questionable case
where a son turns in his father for stealing a sheep, and Confucius condemns the son. Perhaps sheep stealing is not a
serious enough crime to justify overturning filial bonds, but what about rape, or murder? Surely one's father could do
something so heinous that one would have no moral choice but to turn him in?

## Political Limits

89: contra Nussbaum, cosmopolitanism is a form of us versus them thinking, allowing the cosmopolitans to look down upon patriotic rubes.



91: Sandel: " we learn to love humanity not in general but through its particular expressions"


103: 
Rawls and Cohen, declaring a person's natural endowment and circumstances of birth and upbringing as "arbitrary from a
moral point of view" are guilty of a lack of reverence for the world, and our circumstances in it as given to us. They
are waging "a metaphysical crusade against contingency," McPherson, quoting David Wiggins, notes. This is a very
important point, as it undermines Rawls' claim that his political principles are neutral between different comprehensive
conceptions of the good life: in fact, they are dismissive of a conception of the good life based on such nostrums as
"we should count our blessings and not be envious of others."


McPherson notes that Ronald Dworkin has actually elevated envy, a vice, to a "standard of justice." 106



114: contra Cohen's utopianism


115: McPherson too readily accepts the common view of Plato's The Republic as being utopian.

116: utopians are at war with reality


119: "It is better to focus on realizing the good that is possible, and one of the most important reasons for objecting to utopian thinking is that it is counterproductive to realizing this good."


121: a strange list for moderation â€” Plato's "city of pigs"


## Economic Limits

Finally, McP turns to economic limits. Here, he parts ways with almost every political figure in either party, in
rejecting the idea that limitless wealth for everyone is a sensible goal to strive for. In particular, he rejects the
economism so prevalent in both U.S. political parties That holds the highest goal of government to deliver more and more
things to the people, and we're the only disagreement is about the best way to do so.
As McP puts it, "endless economic growth... is senseless without knowing what it is *for*." (131)

Of course, both our right-liberal and left-liberal political pundits will tell us that liberalism certainly does *not*
entail consumerism: under liberalism, they say, people are free to choose whatever sort of values they want, and if they
prefer an Amish or monastic lifestyle, well, they can have it. But, as McP correctly notes, that very attitude,
promoting *choice* as the ultimate value, is itself a comprehensive view: "however, liberalism is in fact, not really
neutral, since it ends up endorsing a particular conception of the good life, namely, the life of the choosing,
preference-satisfying self Which is not 'encumbered' by any strong social ties, and an objective conception of the good
life." (133)

McPherson does a good job debunking the libertarian case for unlimited wealth acquisition, which he finds exemplified in
the work of Jason Brennan. Brennan cranes, the unlimited acquisition of wealth for enabling us to get what we want,
well, ignoring the fact that living a good life is much more about learning to want the right things. (136)

He counters Brennan with the wisodom of Jesus we find in the gospels, for instance, noting the tragedy of the man who
could not surrender his attachment to his worldly goods in order to find true fulfillment. As McP notes:

"Precisely because of how greater wealth enables us to get more of what we want... it gives more free rein to our
desires, and can encourage their multiplication in a way that is unconnected with living a good life, and thus it can
lead ... to our being enslaved to our insatiable desires." (139

143: unlike some critics of homo economicus, McPherson correctly, understands that the rational choice model of human
behavior does not exclude ethical preferences. But, he argues, the irrational choice model "distorts the nature of
ethical reasons which recognize normative standards... for what we ought to desire, and so should not be regarded as
mere preferences among other preferences." (143)

147: Wendell Berry


McP closes his book with a meditation on the importance of "keeping the Sabbath," whether one is Jewish, Christian, or
neither. The idea of a day where we refrain from working, and instead contemplate the life we have worked for and the
world as given to us, is, for McP, a day devoted to the importance of the accepting-appreciating stance.

He claims that "even if one is not a theist, one can recognize the importance of the harmony that is sought here."
But is that really true? Granted, some views of the sacred typically regarded as "non-theistic," such as Buddhism and
Taoism, can recognize the importance of this sought-for harmony. However, I doubt Sutch recognition is really available
to today's hard-core atheistic materialist.


@@ Conclusion


One curious absence in the book is any discussion of transgenderism: rejection of ones given sex and the employment of
unnecessary drugs and mutilating surgery in order to become more like the opposite sex is about a radical rejection of
the "accepting-appreciating stance" as is possible, but McPherson never mentions it. But perhaps he was wise to avoid
doing so, since touching on such a divisive topic might have distracted from his overall thesis.


But who am I not flout this tradition? To do sell wood beef, to fail to recognize my limits

Now no book can possibly deal with every person who has ever written anything on a topic related to its subject.
I may be guilty here of simply griping that this book does not mention some of my favorite thinkers, but I will take that risk, and plunge ahead.


"The politics of imperfection" but no Oakeshott.

I also think that McPherson's work could benefit from referencing the work of Iain McGilchrist on the differences
between right-hemisphere and left-hemisphere thinking, which map quite nicely onto McPherson's differentiation of the
appreciative view and the controlling view.

But these are very minor quibbles: this is an excellent book, both clear and concise. It is not overburdened with references, but
engaging sufficiently with the relevant literature that an interested reader can explore further. And at a time when so
much of our culture regards any limits as abhorrent, and keeps telling us that we can "have it all," it is also a very
timely work.
