Samuel T. Wilkinson, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University, has written a fascinating, albeit flawed book. It is
one in a long line of attempts to show that science and religion are compatible. But, as we will conclude, this is an
unnecessary effort: it is like demonstrating that line dancing does not contradict plumbing.

Wilkinson begins his book in Nashville, Tennessee, in January of 1925.
The scene is the famous "Scopes Monkey Trial," in which the ACLU had found a teacher (John Scopes)
willing to test Tennessee's new law forbidding the teaching of evolution. The trial drew two famous attorneys, William
Jennings Bryan for the prosecution, and Clarence Darrow for the defense, thousands of spectators, and attention from
newspapers nationwide. Both the public and many of the direct participants viewed the trial as not merely a matter of
Tenessee law, but as part of the "argument of science versus religion." (Interstingly, Scopes was *not* one of that
number, as he apparently wasn't even sure if he had ever taught evolution: the local town fathers had prompted him to
volunteer to bring attention and commerce to the town.)

Many people, and many scientists, have read the "meaning" of evolution to be that the existence of humans is a 
chance event, without any significance. As one scientist quoted by Wilkinson put it:

"In the purely natural and inevitable march of evolution, life... is of profound importance... a mere eddy in the primeval
slime."

Wilkinson believes the alarming rise of "deaths of despair" in recent decades is at least partially due to the prevelance
of this nihilistic view of life.
However, he claims that, "through a framework that brings together principles of evolutionary biology,
psychology, sociology, and philosophy, we can infer that there is a purpose to our existence, but *what this purpose
is*." It is this bold claim that makes the book noteworthy; unfortunately, it is also the source of the failure of what
might have been a sound, if much more modest, work.

Wilkinson argues that evolutionary science presents us with two "dilemmas" (although they aren't really dilemmas, but
more unpleasant hypotheses):

1. Many people interpret evolution as implying that our existence on earth is due to mere chance, And, if that is the
   case, it would seem human life could not have a purpose. After all, when we roll a pair of dice, we don't ask what
   the purpose is of their coming up snake eyes.
2. Many people interpret evolution as implying that our fundamental nature is self-centered and our basic relationship
   to others is one of conflict, perhaps veiled with a thin fabric of sociality.

Wilkinson enunciates five principles that he believes will help us to resolve these "dilemmas":

1. Evolution was not random.
2. Nature seems to have created humans with competing dispositions.
3. Free will is a key aspect of human nature.
4. Strong family relationships are crucial to the good life.
5. Strong family relationships are crucial to the good society.

He goes on to make the quite sound point that accepting as fact the idea that humans evolved from non-human ancestors
says nothing about whether we were created by a divine being or not. After all, no one would point to the fact that the
Mona Lisa can be described as the result of physical movements and chemical interactions as proving that Leonardo did
not create it. No one listens to the Fifth Symphony and argues that, because it simply consists of a series of sound
waves that can be described by physics, that means that Beethoven did not compose it. While Wilkinson gestures at this
fact, he does not seem to grasp its full import: a description of some events or processes from the viewpoint of
physical science says nothing about those same phenomena viewed as intelligent actions. These are not rival
accounts of what was occurring, but accounts of the same occurences from two different frameworks.

Wilkinson makes a great deal of the fact that convergent evolution -- similar biological features arising independently
on two or more branches of the "tree of life" -- as being important to his case. He cites a number of examples, such as
wings evolving independently in bats, birds, and insects, the evolution of silken thread production in "at least
twenty-three different types of animals," and the independent evolution of similar eye structures "about half-a-dozen
times." He takes these cases as important evidence that while genetic mutations are random, the overall direction of
evolution is guided by higher-order laws. 

But the importance he goes to this conclusion seems misplaced: after all, he cites experts, such as the atheist
biologist Richard Dawkins, in support of the non-random direction of evolution. Even most diehard atheists do not deny
the fact that, however mysteriously, the elements of the universe seem to obey universal laws. Early giants of the
scientific revolution, such as Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Descartes and Newton, took the existence of these laws to be evidence of
the wonderful workings of the mind of God. But many later, atheistic scientists have simply regarded them as brute
facts. Why would the existence of universal laws constraining the process of evolution strike them as any different
from, say, the law of gravity?


90: "Evolution has biologically primed us to care deeply for our children *and to enjoy caring for them*."

But if we naturally enjoy this, then doing so is not actually a sacrifice!

The same with the experiments Wilkinson cites: if people find altruism enjoyable, then this is easily accounted for in a
rational choice model. To the extent we get enjoyment from "altruism," then there is no more puzzling why people help
others than it is why they go skiing or take motorcycle rides out in the country: they enjoy it.

109: "our drive to cooperate is a natural predisposition"


Wilkinson writes, "Any evolving male hominid who impregnated many female partners would obviously reap significant
evolutionary benefit."

This is a dubiously phrased claim: the individual himself might feel a lot of pleasure in having sex with lots of
partners, he will be long gone before he could see that he has a host of great-great-granchildren. This is why Richard
Dawkins chose to focus on *The Selfish Gene*: it is the satyrs *genes* that "reap significant evolutionary benefit," and
not the satyr himself.

Wilkinson notes that, despite the urgings many feel to experience sexual variety, we also have strong feelings directing
us towards monogamy. As he writes, "In fact, sexual jealousy is a leading cause of homicide and spousal abuse."
The evidence on this matter is a strong refutation of one of the silliest ideas currently circulating in our culture,
the claim that Sex is "merely a private matter." 

Sometimes Wilkinson falls into the error of talking about evolution or nature as if these things were themselves agents,
rather than just abstract aspects of the world of experience. For instance, discussing the difficulty of having an
infant with a large head pass through a woman's birth canal, he asks, "What was nature's solution?"

But "nature", unless we embrace some form of pantheism, is not the sort of thing that can have problems that need to be solved. Why
would it be a problem for "nature" if all hominids went extinct because the females could not survive birth?
In fact, it is estimated that roughly 99% of species that have ever existed are now extinct. If "nature" views this as a
problem, apparently it does ot view it as much of a problem! To be fair, Wilkinson is hardly alone in mistakenly
assigning agency to an abstract concept like nature: many professional biologists commit the same error. (Just search for
"Nature solves this problem" to find examples.)

Wilkinson devotes a chapter to examining whether science refutes the idea that we have free will. (Interestingly, the
title of the chapter, "Free to Choose," is the title of a book by Milton and Rose Friedman, but he does not cite them.)
In this discussion, he relies heavily on the concept of "emergence," which holds that a "higher" level of a physical
system may have properties that could not be predicted from its lower level components. A simple example is the fact
that the properties of water could not be deduced from the properties of hydrogen and oxygen studied in isolation: we
could not predict water's wetness, flow, or surface tension if we only knew of the isolated atoms. Wilkinson quotes
Nobel laurate Philip W. Anderson, who wrote:

"At each level of complexity entirely new properties appear. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied
chemistry. We can now see that the whole becomes not merely more, but very different from the sum of its parts."

On this topic, Wilkinson writes, "Another one of the most remarkable examples of emergence is how the mind emerges from
the brain." However, the idea that the mind "emerges" from the brain is just an undefended assumption. And it is quite
unlike the emergence of the properties of water from the union of hydrogen and oxygen: in the case of water, we are
looking at new physical properties emerging from the physical nature of the parts of water. But in the case of mind,
what we have is something non-physical supposedly "emerging" from something physical. (This is why some materialists
have been anxious to contend that consciousness is "an illusion," since they, to their credit, recognize the difficulty
in positing that this metaphysical transformation could actually take place.)

The Harvard law of animal behavior: "Under controlled experimental conditions of temperature, time, lighting, feeding,
and training, the organism will behave as it damn well pleases."

Epiphenomenalism

If our conscious thoughts are merely epiphenomena, why the heck should they have evolved?



In discussing the issue of free will Wilkinson touches on the famous experiments by Libet.

Simply showing that there is neural activity before a choice is consciously made does nothing to demonstrate that
humans do not make genuine choices.

A company's accounting system

"See, it's mathematics that caused the companies profitability, not anything the employees did!"




167: "The second dilemma was refuted..."


169: "This purpose is to choose between these competing natures"

What kind of purpose is that?

Making some choice or other, cannot be our purpose in life, since we can only make choices based upon some purpose we
have. For instance, if I am driving from my home in South Carolina to New York, I have a choice between I-81 and I-95 as
the main highway I will follow northward. If the purpose of my drive is to arrive as fast as possible in New York, I
will choose I-95. But if my purpose is to enjoy wonderful scenery along the way, I will choose I-81. Making a choice
cannot be our primary purpose, since having any basis for the choice at all presupposes some larger purpose. If I have a
choice between eating a high calorie dessert or not, my choice will depend upon whether I have the purpose of losing
weight, or enjoying myself in the moment.

A consistent nihilist will simply respond to Wilkinson's choice by claiming "It just doesn't matter: choose whatever you want. In the end, it doesn't amount to anything."

After all, if making this choice is my purpose in life, and I decide "OK, let me fulfill my basis, most selfish
desires," then, per Wilkinson, I have achieved that purpose: I made the choice. If he wants to contend that by doing so,
I made the wrong choice, which I think he would contend, then he must criticize my choice based upon its failure to
achieve some purpose beyond the choice itself.

My suspicion here is that Wilkinson, being a Christian, will consider it obvious that we should choose our better
nature, since that is the path to salvation. And that is fine, except that then our purpose is not to make this choice,
but to achieve salvation, and that is quite definitely not something biological science can recommend to us.


In laying out his case for what constitutes "the good life," Wilkinson has occasion to quote the absolutely horrific
advice that the psychologist John B. Watson was offering to new mothers in 1928, which included directions such as
"Never hug or kiss them, never let them sit in your lap..." There is no way of behaving so kooky that some
rationalist hasn't recommended it quite seriously at some point in the past.


Wilkinson lays great stress on the findings indicating that marriage, and other close relationships, make us happier.
And he lays out a case for why this was to our evolutionary advantage.  But neither of those findings are in conflict
with the idea that we are just biological machines, "programmed" to behave in certain ways by "evolution." "So," the
materialist will respond, "evolution 'wants' me to be monogamous and value relationship
relationships.


202: "surely this is the case"

207: no mention of Plato

## The big problem with the book 


Wilkinson's aim is to show us that science indicates, or at least offers support for, his contention that our life is
meaningful and has a purpose. While I am on his side in the debate as to whether ouir lives have meaning, he is
on a misguided venture. That is because science is not the sort of activity that can answer a question, in the
affirmative or negative, such as "does life have meaning?" To expect science to answer question like this is like
expecting your plumber to tell you whether a gold bathtub can make you happier.




The relationship of science to the concrete world can be likened to the relationship of a blueprint to the actual
building it represents. The blueprint can be very valuable, both in the construction of the building, and in its
maintenance and modifications later on. But it would be ridiculous to use the blueprint to show the occupants of the
building that it does not contain any desks or chairs, since they do not appear on the blueprint.

Some nihilistic materialists have attempted to do a similar maneuver: since they do not find a purpose for our existence
anywhere in the abstraction that is science, they tell people that there *is* no purpose, and that life is meaningless.
Wilkinson wants to counter them by claiming that it is possible to find purpose and meaning in the blueprint. While I
appreciate the spirit behind this effort, in doing so, he is making the same category error as are those whom he wishes
to refute. One cannot point to a blueprint to prove or disprove what is inside a building, and one cannot point to
science to disprove *or* prove that life has meaning.





## Notes

Randomness itself is a scientific concept 

39: just wrong: there is no need to "bring these views closer together"

40: "a God who left creation entirely up to chance."

41: "nothing in our study of human nature makes sense except in light of human evolution"
