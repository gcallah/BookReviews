David Hume is primarily known as a philosopher, and his contributions to
economics are typically thought of as secondary to his philosophical concerns.
Schabas and Wennerlid aim to correct this impression, contending that, once we
survey the breadth of Hume's economic thought, we will realize that, rather
than being a philosopher who occasionally commented on economics, "Hume was
engaged in thinking and writing about economics for his entire adult life
and... his contributions are extensive and significant" (5) and that "Hume's
life and writings form an integral whole centered on economics" (6).

This book is an important contribution to Hume scholarship, and makes a good
case for its novel thesis. If this review focuses on its flaws, it is only
because flaws are even more salient against when raised from a quality
background.

In their introduction, the authors sometimes wax rhapsodic about Hume's
accomplishments, writing, for instance, of "his vision for the future of
humanity" (1), or declaring that "His philosophical tenets continue to spread
like the roots and branches of a majestic tree" (3).
Such praise seems to be more suited to a hagiography than an intellectual
biography.

And the authors' desire to endorse Hume sometimes seems to lead them to sloppy
scholarship. For instance, in making the case for Hume’s support for European
minorities, the authors write:

"Hume had written sympathetically about the Jewish money lenders in York, who
in 1189-90 were severely persecuted under King John. About 500 of them were
burned to death to annul outstanding debts." (47)

A reader might be forgiven for thinking that King John had ordered 500 Jews
burned at the stake in York at that time. But our authors’ contention faces
several problems, the foremost of which is that John did not become king of
England until 1199, a decade after which he was supposedly persecuting Jews.
What’s more, every source I can find gives a number of about 150 Jews... who
actually burned themselves, by lighting fire to the tower where they had sought
the crown’s refuge from an angry mob. This was certainly an awful incident, as
the Jews only burned the tower due to their fear of the mob
besieging it. But to find this incident so inaccurately described in a book of
historical scholarship is troubling.

Similarly, the authors contend that Hume's status as an economist is bolstered
by noting that the topics he addressed: "Population, Industry, Coin...
Circulation, Banks, Exchange, Public Credit, and Taxes": still constitute the
core of economics, and that that there is a "dearth of genuinely novel
phenomena"(53) taken up since Hume. This evaluation essentially wipes the
marginalist revolution and the emergence of economics as the study of choice
under conditions of scarcity (see Robbins 2007) out of the history of the
subject. (To be fair, the authors later *do* recognize the existence of the
marginalist revolution... but why not here?)

The authors also mention, in order to cement Hume's status as a precursor to
much of modern economics, that:

"Many of the formal principles and methods the became de rigueur in
twentieth-century economics — game theory, decision theory, and the binomial
theorem — were formulated before Hume... Much of the...
calculus that was adopted in economics by the end of the nineteenth century had
been cemented by the mid-eighteenth century by, for example, Jean d’Alembert,
whom Hume had befriended." (53)

OK, very well, but what does the fact that Hume had befriended an
important figure in calculus, which came to be extensively used in economics a
century after Hume's death, have to do with Hume's status as an economist? And
if, as the authors contend, the binomial theorem is actually important
to modern economics, how is it relevant to our evaluation of Hume's status as an
economist that *someone else* had developed it before him?
The authors generally make a good case for Hume's importance in the history of
economics, so why introduce irrelevancies like these into
the discussion?

Although the focus of this work is not on Hume's metaphysics, I note that
Hume's own take on the status of natural laws -- that we have no real knowledge
of causes, and no reason to think natural laws always have and always will
hold -- clearly undermines his argument against accepting evidence for miracles
(they violate natural laws, so we should never believe in them).
Since the authors discuss both of these aspects of Hume's thought, it
might have been useful to point out this inconsistency.

Schabas and Wennerlind briefly discuss Hume's take on the infamous enclosures
that took place in Britain,
noting, "He blamed the English peasantry for their poor work habits and lack of
initiative. With hindsight, Hume argued, it was clear that they benefited from
the enclosures by being forced to become more industrious and frugal" (109).
The authors let this pass without comment, but it does seriously call into
question how sincere Hume was in his defense of property rights. The peasants
had generations-old rights to the commons that were being taken from them, but
apparently Hume thought this was fine, so long as it made them work harder! One
wonders what he would have thought of a proposal to take all of *his* property
from him, since then he would *really* get busy writing.

In discussing Hume's ideas on price formation, the authors write:
"Hume makes plain that, while prices fluctuate because of supply and demand,
the core or long-standing price is governed by the costs of production..."
(148) Here, it is hard to know if they are just *mentioning* Hume's
mistake, since their "makes plain" seems to indicate they actually believe it.
If the latter is true, that is puzzling: that Hume did not anticipate the
Marginalist Revolution by a century is not surprising, but it is now 150 years
in our past, and anyone writing today ought to realize that there *are* no
"costs of production" separate from "supply and demand": the cost of using my
labor to produce nails *is* the demand for my labor in its most valuable
alternative employment.

In many accounts of the history of economic thought, Hume's monetary theory
is seen as his most important contribution. Naturally, this work addresses this
aspect of his thought, devoting an entire chapter to it. Most of the chapter is
an excellent exposition of Hume's ideas about money: Hume was, indeed, a
pioneer in this field. But one passage here struck me as odd:
"Inasmuch as Hume identified the significance of a variety of self-correcting
mechanisms, money had achieved a considerable degree of autonomy from human
agency" (176). But all of the "self-correcting
mechanisms" are themselves the result of humans acting. Specie does not make
its own way out of a country experiencing inflation: it leaves because human
agents are employing it to buy cheaper goods from abroad.

The penultimate chapter highlights Hume's general support for free trade. It
demostrates that Hume had an inkling of Ricardo's "comparative advantage" case
for doing away with trade barriers. He also anticipated "infant industry" arguments for
restricting trade in special cases. And besides the economic benefits Hume saw
accruing from free trade, he argued that nations tied by trade would be
less likely to go to war with each other.

In this chapter, the authors note Hume's racist views about sub-Saharan
Africans, adding that such views were common among Enlightenment intellectuals.
They also document his strong opposition to government debt. Interestingly,
Hume thought the property of government bondholders is "is the most precarious
of any" (197), quite contrary to the typical contemporary view that the return
on such assets represents the "risk-free" rate of interest. Hume also held a
negative view of investors in government bonds,
writing that they "sink into the lethargy of a
stupid and pampered luxury, without spirit, ambition, or enjoyment" (199).

The last chapter sums up the case for Hume as a significant figure in the
history of economic thought. The authors document at length his influence on
Adam Smith (with whom Hume became a close friend), as well as on such modern
figures as F.A. Hayek, James Buchanan, John Maynard Keynes, Paul Samuelson,
Amartya Sen, Vernon Smith, and Paul Krugman.

The authors conclude their case for the importance of economics to Hume and Hume to
economics by claiming:
"Hume is without equal among philosopher economists; to grasp the full compass
of his economic analysis demands a careful reading of his entire oeuvre and a
concerted effort to situate his economics within his philosophical tenets"
(209)

And I conclude my review by claiming that, while I have quibbles with various
particulars in this book, it is nevertheless an important survey of Hume's
economic thought, which makes a convincing case that his importance as an
economist has been underestimated. I highly recommend it to both Hume scholars
and historians of economic thought.
