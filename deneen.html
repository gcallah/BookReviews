                American conservatives may be cheered by the appearance of a
                book entitled "Why Liberalism Failed." But be forewarned: in
                the sense in which Deneen is using "liberalism," most American
                conservatives are actually liberals
            </p>

            <p>
            "In contrast to its crueler competitor ideologies, liberalism is
            more insidious: as an ideology, it pretends
            to neutrality, claiming
            no preference and denying any intention of
            shaping the souls under
            its rule. It ingratiates by invitation to the easy liberties,
            diversions, and attractions of freedom, pleasure, and wealth."
            -- Patrick Deneen, Why Liberalism Failed, p. 5
            </p>

            <p>
            "The the insistent demand that we choose between protection of
            individual liberty and expansion of state activity masks the true
            relation between the state and market: that they grow constantly
            and necessarily together... Modern liberalism proceeds by making us
            both more individualist and more statist." -- Patrick Deneen, Why
            Liberalism Failed, p. 17
