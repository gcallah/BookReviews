# England's Cross of Gold: Keynes, Churchill, and the Governance of Economic Beliefs

Prior to World War I, Great Britain was the clear leader of the international
gold standard. But Britain went "off gold" to help pay for its war efforts by
printing currency. While this may have helped to defeat Germany, it left open
the question of what to do when the war ended. Should the new fiat currency
regime be made permanent? (It seems this option was barely considered.) Should
Britain return to the gold standard as it had operated before the war? Or
should the opportunity be seized to develop a new version of the standard?

The latter course was chosen, with the final decision resting with Winston
Churchill. The result, as James Ashley Morrison describes in his book, "was a
disaster" (4). The UK lost gold reserves, exports plunged, and unemployment
soared. So how did this disaster come about? And could something have been done
differrently to avoid it?

Morrison makes a great deal of the fact that "the" gold standard meant very
different things in different times and places. No doubt he is right about
that: but given it is so, how can one use this specific incident involving this
particular version of the gold standard to dismiss all of the multifarious
version?


Morrison discusses how Burke thought that governance should proceed "'upon the
principle of reference to antiquity.'"

He then goes on to say "this was 'the Whig[s'] interpretation of history," and
cites Butterfield. But this is pretty much the opposite of what Butterfield
meant by "the Whig interpretation of history," which saw history as steady
progress forward from a benighted antiquity.


Morrison makes the point that attitudes towards monetary policy resembled
religious beliefs. Then he makes it again. And again. And again. Words like
"dogma," "creed," and "heresy" are littered liberally throughout the text. This
reader found that Morrison took an interesting contention and
belabored it so much that he was tempted to reject it simply because it was
being pushed on him so often. 

For someone so enamored of this religious metaphor, Morrison appears to be
somewhat ignorant of religion itself. For instance, he writes, "Because the
gold standard was a matter of religious faith, all expected that adherence to
it would defy logic and rationality" (37). Does Morrison know nothing of the
numerous Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Taoist, and Hindu philosophers
who have argued that religion does not "defy logic and rationality"?

And what about the members of the Cunliffe Committee themselves? They justified
to return to gold based on the fact that "the adoption of a currency not
convertible at will into gold... is likely in practice to lead to over-issue and
to destroy the measure of exchangeable value and cause a general rise in all
prices and an adverse movement in the foreign exchanges" (quoted on 42). While
perhaps the committee members were *wrong* on this point, it certainly looks as
if they thought they had perfectly rational reasons to want to return to the
gold standard, rather than being adherents of some ancient cult.

A few pages later, Morrison himself provides this interesting fact: "[In 1914]
the banks smallest denomination banknote was 5 pounds. Equivalent to
roughly 550 pounds in 2020 pounds..." So, the previous century saw the value of
the pound *drop 100-fold*. It cetainly seems as though the committee's worry
that going off gold would cause "a general rise in all prices" was not only a
rational concern, but a fully justified one!

Morrison goes on to spend several pages listing all of the issues over which
British monetary experts disagreed in the post-WWI period. Their debates sound
very much like a group of people engaged in a discussion over the best course of
practical action, and hardly like a cult adhering to some dogma. But this
doesn't stop Morrison from referring to them as "apostles" (45).

The attack in the gold standard through ridicule continues throughout the book.
For instance, Morrison writes, "For those who clung to the version of the gold
standard professed in the Cunliffe Committeeâ€™s reports..." (180). Not only is
this unnecessarily loaded language, it is misleading: Morrison has already
admitted that the gold standard proposed by the Cunliffe Committee was novel.
How does it make sense to describe people "clinging" to something brand new?

In his chapter in titled "Judgment," Morrison writes, the final "return to
gold" plan actually implemented, "Norman's regime overturned centuries of
practice and scuttled several of the old regime's most salient features... so far
from being driven by nostalgia, Churchhill 'returned' to a reformed, modernized
gold standard..." (269)

He concludes "the return to gold was the wrong choice... But at the time, it was
the best choice given the theory and the evidence available" (270). Morrison's
problem here is that he is too good of a historian to really believe all his
verbiage about "dogma" and "orthodoxy" and so on: when he looks at the actual
evidence, he has to admit that the actors were actually trying new things that
lined up with the best evidence available to them.


In discussing the plan finally adopted for "returning to gold," Morrison notes
that Churchill, like Norman,  "did not buy... the orthodoxy's bogeyman concerns
about the need to shackle the 'wicked chancellor.'" So the failure of a plan
that rejected orthodox gold standard thinking is supposed to show... the
shortcomings of orthodox gold standard thinking?

Britain departed from "the" gold standard during World War I, then, as Morrison
shows us, returned to a vastly modified gold standard after the war. The return
was a disaster. But there are at least three possible conclusions to draw from
this:

1. Returning to gold *at all* was a mistake;
2. Returning to gold the way it was done was a mistake.
3. *Leaving* the gold standard was a mistake.

Morrison handles 2. by giving indications as to why he thinks returning to
the pre-war practices would not have worked. But he never considers 3. at all.
But it is not in the least obvious that the war could not have been financed
differently, and the pain of withdrawing from fiat inflation might have been 
avoided by not having it in the first place. And Morrison does not help his
case for being a sober judge of the right course by his repeated referral to
those who would argue for 3. as "gold bugs."

Any discipline we attempt to put on government financing will depend upon the
government adhering to that discipline. A fiat regime is not subject to the same
sort of problems that a commodity standard is. But it is certainly subject to
problems, such as the fact that it can be used to generate a continual transfer
of wealth from the working class to the investing class, and can lead to
catastrophic hyper inflations, like we have seen in Germany, Hungary, Zimbabwe,
and other countries.


While Morrison stretches his religious analogies to the breaking point, when it
comes to Brexit, he kicks things off already beyond the breaking point. He
clearly doesn't like the gold standard, and clearly doesn't like Brexit, so why
not contend that they are, in some sense, the same sort of thing? Well, because
in one case Britain *returned* to an international institutional arrangement at
the behest of all most all its elite opinion makers, while in the other case
Britain *left* an international institutional arrangement against the advice of
almost all its elite opinion makers. Maybe both decisions were bad, but if so,
they were bad for opposite reasons.


This is really two books in one. Its core is an excellent history of Britain's
return to the gold standard after World War I. Morrison is a skilled and
diligent researcher, and has unearthed a very interesting tale.

Unfortunately, like a live oak draped in Spanish moss, the central story is
carrying an enormous amount of parasitic growth: all of the talk of religion,
orthodoxy, heresy, apostles, Mount Sinai, and so on. Morrison would have done
better to have produced the excellent work of history of which he was clearly
capable, and cleaned his tree clear of all the epiphytes.
