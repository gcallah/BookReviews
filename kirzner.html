            <p>
                Israel M. Kirzner is the dean of the "Austrian school" of
                economics. Over six decades he has produced a stream of papers
                and books defending and extending the insights into the market
                process achieved by his mentors Ludwig von Mises and F.A.
                Hayek. 
                The book under review is part of a 10-volume series collecting
                Kirznerâ€™s works. This volume in particular is a collection of
                essays centered around the theme of entrepreneurship, and
                expanding out from there to include other topics such as
                competition, economic planning, information versus knowledge,
                and advertising. These secondary themes are connected to
                entrepreneurship through Kirzner's understanding of
                entrepreneurship as consisting of alertness to hitherto hidden
                profit opportunities. The constantly changing "data" of the
                market again and again render current market prices
                sub-optimal, offering ever new arbitrage opportunities for
                entrepreneurs to exploit. And it is the correction of those
                pricing errors, by alert entrepreneurs, that tends to push the
                market towards equilibrium.  It is this view of the market that
                leads Kirzner to focus on the <i>process</i> by which these
                sub-optimal conditions are (partially) corrected, rather than
                on a mathematical description of the state of affairs which
                would hold if there were no such errors to correct.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kirzner contrasts his ("Austrian") process-centered
                understanding of the market with the mainstream focus on
                analyzing equilibrium states, in which entrepreneurial activity
                has ceased, because it has no work left to do. Such
                hypothetical states, Kirzner contends, are both of little
                importance for real world markets, and offer no explanation of
                how such an equilibrium might be achieved, or even approached.
                Kirzner focuses his critique on one particular equilibrium model,
                that of perfect competition. In the essay "The Driving Force of
                the Market," he writes:
            </p>

            <p>
                "The model [of perfect competition] cannot be used to 'explain'
                market prices; the model presumes that everyone has, somehow,
                correctly and self-fulfilling guessed what the market price is
                going to be.  The circumstance that (quite apart from the
                assumed correctness of the anticipated price) the model treats
                each market participant as a price-taker further underscores
                the uselessness of the model as an explanation for the manner
                in which prices are adjusted. No one in the model ever does
                change his price bids or offers." -- p. 52
            </p>

            <p>
            In "Knowledge Problems and Their Solutions," Kirzner makes an
            interesting distinction between two types of knowledge problems,
            which I will refer to as type A and type B.  Type A problems
            involve undue optimism, and are self-correcting: if I think I can
            sell my computer programming services for $1 million per hour, I
            surely will be disappointed, and then, if wise, I will lower my
            price. My very attempt to act on my over-optimistic beliefs
            reveals their falsity.
            </p>

            <p>
            Type B problems, on the other hand, involve undue pessimism, and,
            per Kirzner, are not self-correcting. I may believe that my current
            boss, who is paying me $50 per hour, is the best employer I can
            find. But, unbeknownst to me, just down the block is someone who
            would happily pay me $100 per hour, if he knew of my existence. And
            I would happily go work for him, if I knew of his. For type B
            problems to be "corrected" requires entrepreneurial action,
            perhaps, say, a job placement firm that will alert both the
            potential new employer and me to each other's presence in the
            market. The agency arbitrages the difference between my current
            wage and the "correct," market wage, and collects part of that
            difference (its fee) as an entrepreneurial profit.
            </p>

            <p>
            The broader theme under discussion in this essay is to what extent
            Hayek's move from confidence in the error-correcting properties of
            markets to the error-correcting properties of "social evolution" is
            justified. Kirzner argues that Hayek is on solid ground in
            believing that spontaneous social processes will correct type A
            errors, but on much shakier ground if he wishes to contend that
            such social processes can correct type B errors. And the reason for
            this, Kirzner contends, is that the correction of type B errors in
            the market depend upon the lure of entrepreneurial profit, while no
            similar attractant exists in non-market contexts.
            </p>

            <p>
            Hayek cites the evolution of law, language, and money as examples
            of spontaneous social processes: let us grant, for the moment, that
            he is correct about this, something Kirzner is willing to do. But,
            Kirzner contends, such processes exhibit that social agents can
            spontaneously correct type A problems in non-market settings, and,
            at the best, that their self-interested actions might accidentally
            correct a type B problem. (And Kirzner notes the many cases in
            which spontaneous social processes might create an ever-worsening
            situation, such as those highlighted in the work of Thomas
            Schelling.) He offers an analysis of the Mengerian story of the
            evolution of a medium of exchange as an example: the
            entrepreneurial alertness to trade for a more liquid commodity,
            even if it is not that which one ultimately wants to consume, "is
            never alertness to prospects of further increasing that
            liquidity... No entrepreneur could, by himself, discover
            opportunities for pure profit by attempting to move the barter
            society towards the use of money" (p. 102). But... why couldn't
            she? Whether or not any such thing ever actually happened, isn't it
            conceivable that some entrepreneur saw, say, silver being traded
            more-and-more, and so decided to become a market-maker in silver,
            in order to facilitate further increases in the liquidity of
            silver, to his own profit? Nevertheless, Kirzner is correct in
            stating that there is "no basis for any extension of the welfare
            theorems relating to markets to the broader field of the theory of
            institutional evolution. The explanation for such benign
            tendencies, if indeed they exist, must be sought elsewhere" (p.
            103).
            </p>

            <p>
            However, are Type B problems really as little susceptible to
            self-correction as Kirzner contends? Consider the example of
            putting one's house on the market for too low a price: such an
            error is, I suggest, largley self-correcting: if I put my house on
            the market for a price significantly below the market price,
            on the date of the first open house showing, I will be flooded with
            potential buyers, and it will be obvious to me that I have been
            overly pessimistic about the price the house can fetch. Similarly,
            if I own a grocery, and I ask too low a price for my milk, I will
            run out of milk very fast, and it ought to be obvious to me that I
            could charge more for my milk.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the converse case, if I pessimistically believe that I must bid
            too much for a resource -- for instance, if I have started up a new
            tech company, and believe I must bid at least $300,000 to attract
            decent software engineers -- I may be quickly informed of my
            mistake because I am absolutely overwhelmed with software engineers
            applying for my open positions.
            </p>

            <p>
            So it seems to me that Kirzner's analysis of undue pessimism is not
            universal, but applies only to the cases where there are relatively
            few buyers or sellers of a commodity, so that an unduly low bid or
            ask price is not immediately revealed by a flood of sellers or
            buyers.
            </p>

            <p>
            But does this analysis perhaps not also undermine Kirzner's
            analysis of undue optimism? For if there are very few buyers or
            sellers in a market, could it not be the case that my asking price
            for, say, my house, is perfectly fine, and that the fact I have not
            sold it is simply the result of my not having waited long enough
            for the buyer, for whom mine is the perfect property, to come
            along?
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the essays in this volume, like those discussed above,
                are largely in the empyrean of "pure theory." Others descend
                closer to the sphere of economic policy. For instance, in his
                essay "Knowing about Knowledge," Kirzner contends:
            </p>

            <p>
                "Since individuals obviously differ in their entrepreneurial
                alertness, it is clear that opportunities for social
                improvement will tend to be exploited most fruitfully if
                institutional arrangements can be patterned so as to translate
                such opportunities into opportunities that will be encountered
                by those whose entrepreneurial alertness is the most acute, the
                most sensitive, and the most accurate." (p. 216)
            </p>

            <p>
                But what entrepreneurial alertness is alert <i>to</i>, per
                Kirzner, is <i>profit</i> opportunities, not "opportunities for
                social improvement." Now, one could protest that those
                opportunities are the same thing, but then what about an
                entrepreneur who is alert to the fact that the Internet offers
                a "better" way to deliver rape-fantasy videos to those who are
                titillated by the idea of raping women, or alert to the
                possibility of creating a new, far more addictive form of
                opiate that will yield huge profits to its creator? A hedonist
                utilitarian <i>might</i> be able to make a case that these are
                "social improvements": if these innovations are desired by
                those who consume them, then all is well! However, Kirzner is
                not a utilitarian hedonist, and it seems unlikely
                that he would really see them as such. But if he would not,
                then what happens to his case for maximally releasing
                entrepreneurial alertness, given that profit opportunities are
                <i>not</i> equal to opportunities for social improvement?
            </p>

            <p>
                In "Advertising in an Open-Ended Universe," Kirzner offers
                important insights on the difference between economic analysis
                of a "closed universe" and of an "open-ended universe." In the
                closed universe, there are only what Donald Rumsfeld would call
                "known unknowns": an economic agent may be lacking some
                information, but he <i>knows</i> that he lacks it, and does not
                act to acquire it only because the "search costs" of doing so
                are too high. But in Kirzner's "open-ended" universe, there are
                also "unknown unknowns": not only do economic agents not know
                everything possibly relevant to their choices, but they also
                often have no idea of what they do not know. In such a
                universe, "to choose... is to strike out boldly into a largely
                unseen world. To act as a producer... is not to fabricate a
                commodity for a perceived market; it is to create a commodity
                for a market the extent of which must be imagined... [and in]
                which any number of competing producers may be introducing
                novel products at prices that can only be guessed at" (p. 249).
                The "open-ended" universe is surely a more accurate description
                of the actual choice situation of economic agents than is the
                closed one, whether one fully buys into the defense of
                advertising Kirzner draws from the distinction or not.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many more essays in this volume worth reading and
                pondering, but those discussed above should suffice as a
                representative sample of the rest of the contents. Hopefully,
                they are enough to demonstrate that Israel Kirzner is no mere
                "market ideologue," but a serious theorist of the market
                process. Kirzner's work contains penetrating insights as to the
                nature of economic reality, insights that have something to
                teach even those who do not share his sunny optimism about the
                outcomes likely to be yielded by a laissez-faire economic
                policy.
