## Liberalism's Collapse


The correct argument against the 10-hour clock is that the French revolutionaries had been hypnotized by the fact that
they counted in base 10 into thinking that measuring everything in multiples of ten was somehow more rational than
any other multipler, such as 12 or 24. And therefore there was no reason to do away with dividing the day into 24 hours: no division is
more rational than any other, and so it is more sensible to use the conventional divisor, and not disrupt everyone's time
keeping to switch to a different, and equally arbitrary, divisor.

But Pilkington instead claims: "the 24-hour day and the calendar that grows out of it are based on lived reality of
night and day as it occurs on earth" (36).

Certainly, our lived reality tells us that some part of each day is dark, and some part is light. 
But nothing about our lived reality demands that we divide each day into 24 hours. In Japan, for instance, the day and
the night were each divided into six "hours." In Muslim countries, the main divisions of the day are the times of the
five daily prayers. In ancient India, the day was divided into eigth *prahars*. And in medieval Europe, monasteries
divided the day by the eight times of prayer: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. These
traditional divisions were, in fact, more in tune with our lived reality, as they typically varied these divisions as
the daylight period grew shorter or longer. It was only with the widespread usage of mechanical clocks that the idea of
dividing the day into 24 equal periods became common: It was itself a fitting of our lived experience into the
requirements of a machine.


Pilkington writes: "There are many variants of the classic metaphysic, from Platonism to Aristotelianism and everything
in between" (30). But R.G. Collingwood, Lloyd P. Gerson, Eric Voegelin and other have argued that Aristotle in fact only
represented a slight shift from Plato's views, giving somewhat more emphasis to immanence than to transcendence. The
ancient world contained a much wider variety of metaphysical thought, such as the materialism of Democritus and
Lucretius or the work of the pre-Socratics such as Thales, Anaximander, Parmenides and Zeno, to say nothing of Eastern
metaphysics.


## Military



All my libertarian friends would immediately recognize the problem with comparing military spending and consumer
spending: the first is coerced and thus does not reflect the voluntary choices of market participants.
So is this really a case where liberal ideology leads people astray?

Pilkington contends that in the case of technological advances, "The technologies themselves were developed by the
state..."

It is true that, for instance, the Internet began as a DARPA project. But what about the myriad of technologies
developed by such private companies, such as those coming from Toyota, 3M, Bell Labs, or Xerox PARC, just to name a few.
A free-marketer might well respond to Pilkington, "Think how much more the private sector might've developed if so
much R&D energy wasn't diverted to government use?"

Pilkington may have a good answer to this question, but he skirts over this issue too lightly in his book.



## Demographic

Pilkington notes that once liberalism thoroughly infects a society, that society's birth rate begins to plummet, always
to below replacement rate. This fact can hardly be disputed, since it has held without exception. Thus liberals are
faced with the awkward fact that liberal societies universally commit demographic suicide.

The response on the part of most liberal nations has been to import people to make up for the deficit in native births.
But, as Pilkington points out, this solution both ignores the societal strains of incorporating large numbers of
immigrants who are not familiar with their new culture, and runs in contradiction to liberal imperialism: once liberal
values are exported to all nations, as is the liberal dream, than there will no longer be nations with above-replacement
birth rates from which to import people.

A minor quibble here is that Pilkington repeatedly uses the phrase "rate of people" instead of the more usual "birth
rate": I cannot see any reason for this change of terminology, nor does he offer one.


Sexual consumerism

Stupid idea: "sex is a purely private affair"

Raising awareness of STDs: word magic!



## Macroeconomic

When it comes to international trade, Pilkington interestingly revives a proposal by John Maynard Keynes for using a
planned system involving a notional trade currency called the "bancor" and a schedule of remedies for persistent trade
surpluses such as forced investment by the nation running a surplus in the nation experiencing the deficit.

Pilkington, unfortunately, does not present any argument as to why persistent trade deficits are worrisome. The standard
response from advocates of free trade to such worries is to present an analogy where I, a computer programmer,
habitually run a "trade deficit" with my local grocer: I regularly buy his groceries, but he never purchases any of my
software. And the point of the free trade case here is there is no cause for me to worry about this situation. Of
course, there may be reasons why scale matters here, and that my trade deficit with the grocer is a flawed analogy with
one nation's trade deficit with another, but Pilkington does not provide such reasons.
