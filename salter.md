Alexander Salter has written an important book, examining how the political program of distributism can inform
contemporary debates about political economy. The fact that Salter is a trained economist with a PhD is significant,
since it indicates that taking distributism seriously might be simply a symptom of ignorance of
"scientific" economics.

Despite Salter's sympathy with distributist thought, he never gives the architects of distributism (chiefly G.K.
Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc) a free pass: he continually tests whether their ideas appear plausible given commonly
accepted economic theory.


"Man needs not just a shelter but a *home*, and socialism cannot distinguish between the two." (92)


Chesterton sees the battle between Tories and socialists as little more than a pantomime, disguising the awful
possibility that they are "secretly in partnership; the quarrel they keep up in public is very much of a put-up job; and
that the way in which they perpetually play into each other's hands is not an everlasting coincidence (92-93)

"It never seems to strike these people, that the lesson of lice in the slums of the wrongness of slums, not the
wrongness of hair." (93)


Salter spend some time discussing Mary Hirschfeld's work *Aquinas and the Market*. Her spell notes that well economics
discusses efficiency, in terms of what means unemployed to achieve any ends whatsoever, Aquinas holes that "human choice
is not about efficiently getting what we want so much as it is about learning how to want what is genuinely good" (144,
Salter quoting Hirshfeld). There is no virtue in being very efficient about achieving evil ends. Salter contends that
while Hirshfeld's work points us towards a humane *economics*, Belloc and Chesterton's program is about creating a
humane *economy*. Thus, Salter concludes, these are two complementary research programs that should be united.


Where can the minimum wage be set so that it is correct for a parent supporting several children, one member of a couple
going back to work part time while the other is working full-time, a single person living on their own, a teenager
living at home with his parents, and someone with some other means of support who is trying to get going in some highly
desirable line of work. (for instance, a band starting out may be willing to play a good location for free, in order to
gain fans, but that rate of pay is certainly below any possible minimum wage.) Belloc, Chesterton and Röpke would all
agree that, better than trying to artificially prop up the wage of a proletarian worker, let's de-proletarianize him.
(And, by the way, so would Marx and Engels, who disdained things like minimum wage legislation.)

The economic incidence of a tax 

Our workers really "paid their marginal product"? When it comes to individual brokers, the idea is preposterous: I have
worked with many companies I'm not a single one of them ever had any idea what the "marginal product" of any individual
worker was. When it comes to different categories of work, or as a whole, it would be true that they would get paid
their marginal product in Mises "imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy": but Mises was quite clear that
this is an *imaginary* construction. So even setting aside, political interventions and power dynamics, there is still
room for Chesterton's‘s argument to have validity. 


A key figure for Salter is the German economist Wilhelm Röpke, who married Belloc and Chesterton's concerns about
proletariazation and the inhuman scale of modern life with a rigorous knowledge of economic price theory. Salter devotes
two chapters to Röpke, the first to show that his social concerns are remarkably similar to those of Bellow and
Chesterton (both of whom Röpke cites), and the second to demonstrate his grasp of economic theory and its importance to
his recommendations for reform.




As someone who has repeatedly committed the venial sin of reviewing academic books, I find too many academic writers
seem to believe that the best way of showing one's intelligence is to write obscurely. Salter does not suffer from that
illusion: his writing is always pellucid. A minor quibble: Salter does employ the contemporary, nearly instinctual habit
of announcing in advance or retrospectively repeating one's main argument. At one point he writes, "It will be helpful
to summarize the arguments thus far" (127). My reaction was, "Not really: I have been following along." I cannot recall
a single classic work of philosophy, social theory, or history that follows this method: I think it is a journalistic
trick appropriate for casual readers of newspapers that has unfortunately leaked into academic writing.


If I might be so bold as to try to capture the "main message" of Salters book, it might be that:

1. Those who attempt social reform without understanding price theory are likely to make foolish mistakes that result in
   the opposite effect of what they wished to achieve.
2. Those who rely only on price theory in devising, social policy, are likely to make in human mistakes that ignore all
   the things about people and their common life that cannot be captured in a supply-and-demand diagram.
