            Review of <i>Language and the Structure of Berkeley's World</i>
        </h1>

            <h3>
                <i>
                    Language and the Structure of Berkeley's World
                </i>
                Kenneth L. Pearce,
                Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2017.
            </h3>

            <p>
                Pearce's central thesis is that for Berkeley, the perceived
                world is, in fact, a discourse in a language -- what language,
                we shall see later -- and that our own talk about things like
                bodies, causes, and forces seek to reflect the architecture of
                that discourse. Pearce contends that "in this way, Berkeley
                succeeds in preserving the common sense and scientific
                structure of the world" (3). Thus, as Pearce interprets
                Berkeley, entities like bodies and forces are linguistic
                constructs, "part of our project of interpreting the language
                of nature" (3).
            </p>

            <p>
                Pearce describes his method of proceeding as "intellectual
                history in the service of philosophy" (3). By this, he means he
                aims to follow a middle path between a purely analytical
                approach to the "Great Dead Philosohper's" ideas, which treats
                them ahistorically, as if they were a submission to a recent
                conference on ontology or epistemology, and a purely historical
                approach, which focuses only on the context of those ideas.
                Although he seeks a balance, he insists that "the contextual
                must precede the analytic" (4). This is so, he argues, because
                these figures really are great philosophers, and therefore 
                "the positions they actually held" and "the arguments they
                actually made," when understood within the context of "the
                arguments and positions to which he was responding", are
                superior to how they might appear based on "a casual reading of
                a handful of well-known texts" (4).
            </p>

            <p>
                Pearce begins by laying out Berkeley's attack on the "Theory of
                Meanings", by which is meant the notion that "every significant
                name stands for an idea" (8).
                This theory was "'received opinion' in Berkeley's
                day" (8), and this is what he sets out to undermine at the
                beginning of <i>The Principles of Human Knowledge</i>. Berkeley
                was motivated here by his conviction that this theory
                undermined belief in religious mysteries, but rather than
                confine his assault to that area alone, he argued that
                "as an attempt to make sense of mind, language, and knowledge,
                the Theory of Meaning is a total failure" (12).
            </p>

            <p>
                Per Pearce, Berkeley rejects the Theory of Meanings by
                examining the case of words like "triangle", which are said to
                represent abstract ideas, since they correspond to no
                particular idea, and according to the theory, every word must
                indicate <i>some</i> idea: thus, "triangle" must indicate an
                <i>abstract</i> idea. But Berkeley makes a phenomenological
                case that we cannot really conceive of such things as abstract
                ideas. But why, then, do people suppose they exist? Berkeley
                pins the blame on the Theory of Meanings: since the word
                "triangle" is meaningful, and corresponds to no
                <i>particular</i> idea, it must instead correspond to an
                abstract one. But that conclusion is only necessary <i>if</i>
                we accept the Theory of Meanings! To the contrary, Berkeley
                holds, "there are meaningful uses of language where the aim is
                to do something other than excite an idea, such as evoke an
                emotion or a practical response" (15). Since "general words
                such as 'triangle' are paradigmatic examples of meaningful bits
                of language... The linguistic conventions that make words
                meaningful must therefore not consist merely in a a mapping of
                words to meanings" (15).
            </p>

            <p>
                Further, for Berkeley, these supposed abstract ideas do not do
                the work they are supposed to do: if we state that the interior
                angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we are saying
                something about <i>all</i> particular triangles, and not about
                "some mysterious entity, The Universal Triangle" (28).
                The latter (fictitious) entity plays no actual role in
                understanding this geometrical theorem. General words,
                such as "line", gain their meaningfulness not by being
                signs of an abstract idea of "line", but by being signs of "all
                particular lines that may possibly exist" (35).
            </p>

            <p>
                Contrary to the Theory of Meanings, only a small portion of
                human language usage is concerned solely with the communication
                of meanings. Instead, much of our discourse is aimed at
                eliciting some emotion, or advising for or against some course
                of action, or of simply creating some particular state of mind.

            <h3>
                Rules and Rule-Following
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the chapter on rules and rule-following, we discover
                Berkeley as a proto-Wittgenstein, recognizing that humans often
                follow rules implicitly, many times without knowing how to even
                state the rule they are following. They do so by "suggestion",
                which anticipates Wittgenstein's insight that the ability to
                follow a rule depends upon participation in "a way of life".
                In the same vein, Berkeley also recognizes that
                "some implicit rule-following
                must... be prior to any explicit rule-following" (73).
                And, as a proto-Ryle, Berkeley recognizes that the ability to
                follow a rule "is really an ability, or a kind of
                know-<i>how</i>" (75).
            </p>

            <p>
                We also find that Berkeley anticipated C.S. Peirce's division of
                signs into indices, icons, and symbols, as he contended that
                one idea can suggest another "by likeness [icon], by necessary
                connexion [index]... or by arbitrary convention [symbol]" (69).
                (The correspondence is not exact, however, since Berkeley
                includes a fourth category he calls "geometrical inference".)
            </p>

            <p>
                The upshot of this chapter is that, for Berkeley,
                "only rule-following can underlie genuine
                regularity", it follows that "the laws of nature can be
                nothing other than the rules followed by God" (75).
                "'Force', 'gravity', 'attraction', and similar terms are useful
                for reasoning, and for calculations about motion and moving
                bodies" (84), but they do not reflect ultimate, metaphysical
                realities, unlile "the nouns used in metaphysics and theology"
                (85).
            </p>

            <h3>
                Reference and Quasi-Reference
            </h3>

            <p>
                As noted above, Berkeley famously held that there
                are no abstract general
                ideas. Pearce explains that instead, for Berkeley "a word
                becomes general by being made the sign... of several particular
                ideas" (89). General ideas are <i>labels</i>, but labels that,
                rather than being applied to a particular thing, are, according
                to some rule, applied to a number of particular things wich all
                share some resemblance.
                
                Berkeley's famous claim that "<i>esse</i>
                is <i>percipi</i>" is true for him because "exists" is
                such a label, and there cannot sensibly be a rule that directs us to
                apply that label to something unperceived by any mind.
                <br />
                
                Forces, such as gravity, exist for Berkeley as theoretical
                constructions made by physicists to help them model nature, and
                not as part of "the very truth of things" (95).
            </p>

            <h3>
                Quasi-Referring to Bodies
            </h3>

            <p>
                For Berkeley, the belief in the existence of bodies possessing
                a stable essence arises due to the same sort of muddle that 
                leads to positing forces as really existing entities:
                "The materialist is confused about plain language <i>in just
                the same way</i> the physical realist is confused about the
                formal language of physics" (102). In both cases, the fact that
                it is <i>useful</i> to apply a general label to certain
                collections of sensory experience can mistakenly lead to the
                idea that there are actual things being so labelled. However,
                "<i>bodies, like forces, are mere quasi-entities</i>" (97).
            </p>

            <p>
                But this does not at all imply that we can't distinguish
                "between realities and chimeras", because "the ideas of
                sense... have <i>more reality</i> in them, that is, to be more
                strong, orderly, and coherent than the creatures of the mind"
                (120).

                Assent and Truth
            </h3>

            <p>
                One of the most fascinating aspects of Pearce's work is how he
                unravels Berkeley's view of the truth of Christianity. Berkeley
                holds that both in ordinary and scientific language, "assent
                without ideas is a widespread phenomenon" (152). We assent to
                language that does not correspond to any idea when such assent
                enables to get on better in the world, e.g., we use the
                languages of "forces", even though we have no idea
                corresponding to "a force", because by doing so we are better
                able to predict the motion of objects in space. Similarly, to
                say, for instance, that one "believes" in the doctrine of the
                trinity is to assent to having one's life shaped by such a
                notion, and the "truth" of such language consists in the fact
                that those who truly assent to have their lives shaped by it
                thereby lead better lives. Or, as Pearce puts it regarding
                another belief, "The doctrine of the divinity of Christ
                produces a practical, interpersonal attitude <i>toward
                Christ</i>" (154).
            </p>

            <p>
                Pearce notes that Berkeley's view is that the truth of any
                individual proposition can only be evaluated based on "its role
                in a broader sign system": once again, we find Berkeley as a
                precursor of later philosophical developments; in this case, it
                is the coherence theory of truth embraced by later British
                idealists.
            </p>

            <h3>
                The Linguistic Structure of Berkeley's World
            </h3>


            <p>
            Pearce argues that, for Berkeley, "bodies" are linguistic constructions
            built up from our phenomenal experience, and that causal talk, in
            everyday life and in physics, is an extension of that sort of
            operation. But Berkeley does not therefore dismiss such talk. The
            reason is twofold:
            </p>

            <ol class="nested">
                <li>
            First of all, to model things this way is useful: it helps us "in
            the pursuit of happiness, which is the ultimate end and design...
            that sets rational agents at work" (204).
                </li>

                <li>
            But these ideas are also true, in an important sense: they reflect
            the underlying reality of "the regular ordering of ideas instituted
            by God, i.e., the linguistic or grammatical structure of the divine
            language of nature. Our talk about bodies aims to capture the
            lexicon of this language, and our talk about causes, laws, and
            forces aims to capture its syntax" (204).
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                Pearce has penned an impotrant new contribution to Berkeley
                scholarship, one that aims to clear up many of the supposed
                paradoxes in Berkeley's thought that have puzzled other
                scholars. This reviewer believes he has largely succeeded in
                that task. But whether or not one accepts that conclusion, this
                is a work that cannot be ignored in future work on this "Great
                Dead Philosopher."
