            Getting Under Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Skin
        </h1>

        <p>
            Nassim Nicholas Taleb hates being called an "intellectual," so
            let's instead refer to him as a thinker, and go on to note
            that he is one of the most important thinkers of our time.
            That importance comes not so much from the volume of work he has
            produced, as from the fact that, with each new book, he
            gives his readers a significant new lens through which 
            one can look at the world. Furthermore, each book has grown out
            of the previous one, such that something mentioned briefly
            in one book would become the theme of the next one. And
            all of this work has been unified by the theme of 
            how to proceed in life in the face of "the dark forces
            of time and ignorance," informed by a deep knowledge of probability
            and statistics, and gleeful in its skewering of IYIs (intellectual
            yet idiots) who understand just enough about uncertainty to
            massively screw things up.
        </p>

        <p>
            In <i>The Black Swan</i>, his most famous work
            (described as one of "Twelve Books That
            Helped Change the World" in the UK <i>Sunday Times</i>), Taleb
            noted how little we really can say about the "tails" of 
            probability distributions that we suppose we can model. The
            book has been credited with foeshadowing the financial crisis of
            2008. The importance of "tail risk" might be understood, in
            the context of that meltdown, as follows: the banks investing 
            in mortgages relied on models that assumed the risk of a
            nation-wide decline in housing prices in the US was 
            minute. But how "minute" is minute? Once in 100 years?
            Once in 1000 years? Once in 10,000 years? The banks chose the 
            "extremely unlikely" end of that spectrum, but they did so based 
            upon... only a few decades of data on the US housing market!
        </p>

        <p>
            "Anti-fragility" was a minor theme in <i>The Black Swan</i>,
            but it became the major one of his next full-length work
            (he released a book of aphorisms in between) <i>Antifragile: Things
            That Gain from Disorder</i>. This work introduced a whole new
            category into our thinking about the impact of randomness on
            entities in the world. Formerly, things were generally thought
            of as being robust -- able to withstand some random shocks --
            or fragile, and easily broken by such shocks. But <i>Antifragile</i>
            insisted on the need for a third category, the eponymous
            antifragile, which contains things that become stronger
            when stressed. The concept caught on slowly at first,
            but is now finding applications in medicine, nutrition, exercise,
            finance, politics, physics, and information technology.

        <p>
            His new book, <i>Skin in the Game</i>, extends observations made
            about asymmetrical risk in <i>Antifragile</i> into a thesis about
            how human institutions "learn" over time. In addition, the book 
            analyzes large swaths of ethics as conceerned with unequal
            distributions of "skin in the game."

            Christology is also examined 
            in light of the book's overarching theme, and
            Taleb finds that the Church Fathers were wise: Christ <i>had</i>
            to be fully human, or he wouldn't have had "skin in the game":
            a divine figure just playing at being human, a la Zeus
            or visiting angel, isn't really risking anything.

        class of people who are better at explaining than understanding" --

        Beliefs aren't rational, only actions are:

        "There is no such thing as the 'rationality' of a belief, there is
        rationality of action." --  p. 220
        </p>

        <p>
        "How much you truly 'believe' in something can be manifested only
        through what you are willing to risk for it." -- p. 223
