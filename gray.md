# The New Leviathan: Thoughts after Liberalism

Reviewing one of John Gray's recent books is an adventurous undertaking. Rather than straightforward histories, or
philosophical or political arguments, or personal reminiscences, Gray seems to have adopted the approach to his
non-fiction work that Milan Kundera took to his novels: they are meditations on a topic, approaching it through a
variety of vantage points: some anecdotes, some historical episodes briefly narrated, a few interesting (and sometimes
horrifying) statistics, a witty or trenchant aper√ßu here, a brief argument there. It worked (wonderfully, I'd claim) for
Kundera's novels, and it also works for Gray's books. But it does not confront the humble reviewer with a simple
undertaking.

His newest book highlights the nature of the work right in the sub-title: "Thoughts after Liberalism." This is not an
argument that liberalism has failed (such as Patrick Deneen's *Why Liberalism Failed* -- Gray takes its failure largely
as a given), or a program for what should come after liberalism (like the recent work of Curtis Yarvin), or a
philosophical critique of liberalism (which Gray himself has offered in ealier works). Instead, it is as though the
reader has been invited to eavesdrop on Gray's inner dialogues as he mulls over a post-liberal world.

While it might be possible to review this work in the same style in which it was written, well, that would be like
putting hot sauce on a dish of chili peppers: a bit much. Instead, I will organize this review round several of the
themes that are important in the book, and offer a sample of what Gray has to say about each one.


## Hobbes

In a book the title of which contains the word "Leviathan," we naturally would expect Thomas Hobbes to be a key figure.
And indeed he is: Throughout his meditations, Gray brings up Hobbes again and again. In fact, if one were to be so bold
as to offer a "central message" of the book, it would be that the circumstances that prompted Hobbes to write
*Leviathan* have again become salient in our time, as the liberal world order that prevailed for some years after the
fall of the Soviet Union collapses around us.

Very early on, Gray writes: "Hobbes was a liberal -- the only one, perhaps, still worth reading." (4) In defense
of the first half of this claim, he presents the four characteristics of liberalism provided in his own book,
*Liberalism*, to wit, liberalism is:

1. individualist
2. egalitarian
3. universalist
4. meliorist

And he goes on to argue that the above key liberal ideas are present in Hobbes in that, for him:

1. "Society is made up of individuals..."
2. "equal in being exposed to death at each other's hands..."
3. "Human nature is universal in its needs..."
4. "With the application of reason, government can be improved..." (5)

This Hobbes is "the" proto-liberal. 
However, as Gray explains, "Each of these [liberal] ideas is a half-truth,":

1. Individuals *are* the basis of society, but "self-preservation, is only one of their needs: bare life is not enough."
2. Human beings "regularly give up peace and security in order to defend a form of life...",
2. "The most basic human goods may be universal but they are often sacrificed..."
3. "Society and government can be improved, but what is gained can always be lost... There is no complete or final exit
   from the state of nature." (5)

Gray's claim that Hobbes was a liberal may disconcert some who have interpreted Hobbes as a totalitarian; but
here Gray makes a crucial, often over-looked, point about Hobbes:

"Hobbes's was a state whose powers were unchecked, but its goals were strictly limited. Beyond security its subjects
against one another and external enemies, it had no remit." (2)

Or, as Michael Oakeshott (whom Gray refers to as one of Hobbes's "best interpreters")
put it, "Hobbes is not an absolutist precisely because he is an authoritarian..." In other words, Hobbes's state existed
to keep its citizens from going to war with each other, and had whatever power it needed to meet that task.
But its remit did not include stopping them from smoking, or encouraging them to save
more for retirement, or making them more understanding of homosexuals, or prompting them to read more elevating
literature or better appreciate art.

Hobbes appears again and again in this book, including epigraphs from *Leviathan* (or occasionally another work of his)
that head each chapter and sub-chapter.


## Liberalism

The previous section outlined Gray's key aspects of liberalism, and offered a brief synopsis of why he argues each is
only a half-truth. But he has much more to say about liberalism than that. For example, he notes a similarity between
contemporary liberals and the "ideologues" they set themselves in opposition to:

"The psychology of the political believer is not confined interwar communists and fellow travelers. The same mixture of
self deception and adamant certainty can be observed in post-Cold War liberals. They, too, cannot admit the demise of
the faith that has given meaning to their lives." (102)

Gray understands that the whole liberal project is based upon a metaphysics that modern liberals at best ignore, or, at
worst, completely reject:

"Liberalism was a creation of Western monotheism and liberal freedoms part of the civilization that monotheism
engendered. Twenty-first-century liberals reject this civilization, while continuing to assert the universal authority of a
hollowed-out version of its values. In this hyper-liberal vision all societies are destined to undergo the
deconstruction that is underway in the West." (109)

Passages like this show Gray at his best, as a sharp critic of contemporary, thoughtlessly assumed verities.

Many contemporary liberals are advocates of (almost?) unlimited immigration into liberal societies. Gray notes that, for
the leaders of the Soviet Union, "The emergence of a new human type required the systematic severing of human beings from
their cultural roots" (33). This principle appears to be exactly what is behind the liberal infatuation with promoting
the maximum possible relocating of contemporary humans: once they are severed from their cultural roots, the hope is
that they will have no alternative but to embrace liberalism.

"Populism" is a current bogeyman of contemporary liberals. But, as Gray points out, "populism... has no clear meaning,
but it is used by liberals to refer to political blowback against the social disruption produced by their own policies."
(133)

## History

The nature of history is another theme that runs throughout this book.
Given that Gray regards history as an essentially undirected process, it is unsurpising that
he is not kind to Francis Fukuyama's book, *The End of History and the Last Man*. He notes that Fukuyama's
declaration of what history held in store for humanity is remarkably similar to Sidney and Beatrice Webb's announcement
that Stalin's USSR was the "end of history," and our "New Civilization" would be built on Stalin's totalitarian model.

Gray examines the Hegelian roots of Fukuyama's work, "in which history showed one idea following another in dialectical
succession." (17) But, he contends, "In reality, no such history ever transpired. History with a capital letter is like
Humanity, an iridescent operation." (18) (I'm not sure why 'iridescent' is the word he chose here.)

He argues that events since Fukuyama's book was published argue against his thesis:

"All the evidence suggests that we are moving back into an epoch that is classically historical, and not forward into
the empty, hallucinatory post-historial era projected in Fukuyama's article... The grotesque notion that history was
coming to an end in a universal convergence on American-style democracy was feted as realism." (19)

Howevewr, Gray claims that "While history is not the unfolding of reason, there can be logic in particular situations." (22) But
he does not provide any argument for believing that a process that is irrational should present us with "particular
situations" that are amenable to logical analysis: how could such situations arise? How can we identify them? He is
silent on these crucial questions.

Gray also offers interesting insight on the difference between the Russian tsarist regime and the Soviet Union:

"Whereas the Romanov empire was a traditional despotism, the Soviet state was a new Leviathan... Aiming to fashion a
new humanity." (25) The difference was made manifest in the execution rate: "In the 50 years from 1867 to 1917, they were
around 25,000 deaths from executions and progroms. In the first five years of the Soviet states existence, there were
around 200,000 executions..." (26) And this ignores deaths in camps: so the Soviet Union was killing its citizens at at
least 100 times the rate of the Czars. And the difference is that the Czars just wanted to hold oonto power, while the
Soviet leaders were fanatically pursuing an ideological vision.


## Rationalism and Science

"The social contract of which Hobbes writes is a rationalist myth." (12)

"Hobbes's pessism is only seeming. When he asserts that self-preservation is the path to peace, he writes not as a
realist but as a utopian visionary."

"Hobbes believed humankind could escpae the spell of language by constructing clear definitions of words. Here he
was misled by rationalism." (15)


"The Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and Maoist China killed in order to perfect humanity, or the part of it they judged to
survive." (17)



### Evolution

As someone who has read Michael Oakeshott, one would think that Gray careful to distinguish the
presuppositions of a theory from any discoveries made using it. Nevertheless, he writes:

"Here Fukuyama departs from the most important discovery in modern science. As understood by Charles Darwin, evolution
has no destination." (20)

But this is not something Darwin "discovered": how could it be? We would need a perspective looking backward from the
end of time to "discover" whether evolution has a destination. What Darwin did was pre-suppose that evolution proceeds
via random mutations, and then tried to see if he could explain the origin of species using that presupposition. The
fact that his theory does not contain a telos for evolution is hardly surprising, since that was an assumption fed in
in order to formulate the theory.

Gray follows this up by claiming, "Natural selection of genes is a purposeless process that is going nowhere." (20)
His statement of this, as a Balde fact is particularly surprising, given two later statements he makes in this same
book. At one point, he admits that "The accidental origins of Christianity, of course, prove nothing. For a believer,
chance is the work of providence." (124) (Of course, this would be better stated as, "For the believer, what may appear
to us as chance is actually the workings of an infinite mind.") So the fact that John Gray sees no purpose to evolution
hardly shows that it has no purpose. And in another passage, Gray notes that "



## Woke-ism

Gray is not pleased with "what has come to be called the woke movement," declaring that its
"origins... are in the decay of liberalism." (110)

He notes that 
"If Western capitalism creates an expanding underclass without any productive function, it also produces a lumpen
intelligentsia that is economically superfluous." (111)

In other words, in societies that are in serious need of more auto mechanics and carpenters and plumbers, we are instead
producing far more doctors of gender studies and queer theory and even of English literature than are actually demanded:
so what can these "superfluous" individuals do to make a living? Well, they fight for jobs based on who is "most woke,"
which is a "vehicle through with surplus elites struggle to secure a position of power in society." (110)
Or, as Gray also puts it, "In their economic aspects, woke movements are a revolt of the professional bourgeoisie." (111)

Gray quite correctly debunks the claim that the woke movement is accurately described as "cultural Marxism":
"Contrary to its right wing critics, woke thinking is not a variety of Marxism. No woke ideologue comes anywhere close to
Karl Marx in rigour, breadth and depth of thought." (111)
In fact, 
"Once questions of identity become central in politics, conflicts of economic interest can be disregarded. Idle
chatter of micro-aggression screens out class hierarchy and the abandonment of large sections of society to idleness
and destitution." (111) In other words, identity politics, far from being "Marxist," are actually a way to divert
attention *away* from class issues towards relative trivialities.

This reminded me of a recent episode in my own professional field of software engineering: the popular developer site
GitHub decided to stop calling the principal code branch of a project the "master" branch, and instead call it "main":
because "master" might remind some programmer somewhere of slavery. I am sure the people who organized this change felt
very virtuous for their "social awareness," but I wondered just how impressed a poor child growing up in a crime-plagued
housing project would be at their "effort." And can we really console this child for the fact that society has no place
for him to make a contribution by pointing out that we now spell "Black" with a capital "B"? These are not "steps in
the right direction": they are steps by which the privileged hope to conceal the fact they are not actually doing
anything substantive at all for the underprivileged.



"Human beings can never be wholly self-defined." (109)




"Human beings repress their awareness of death by identifying themselves with a supposedly timeless idea or belief..."
(147). Is Gray really unaware of the tradition of _Memento Mori_ practiced in Christianity, or the countless skulls
found in Indian and Tibetan art?




## Conclusion: The Meaning(lessness) of Life

This book is a fascinating exploration of Gray's thoughts on a post-liberal world. Given the style of the work, it is
often hard to say when Gray is presenting "something interesting to think about" and when he is presenting "here's what
I think." So often it is not clear whether to critique some notion as Gray's own or not.

Nevertheless, there is a clear thread running throughout the work, one asserting that human life is a random emergence from
the inherently meaningless movements of matter in a universe lacking any purpose. As such, Gray, in spite of his own
views, shows the importance of faith. He is an intelligent and perceptive observer and critic of "the world of the
flesh," and is honest enough that he cannot hide from its ultimate meaninglessness (without illumination by the world of
the spirit). The result, as Gray so ably demonstrates, is bleak, but the bleakness only arises from his rejection of the
world of the spirit.
