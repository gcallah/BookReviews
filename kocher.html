                This is an interesting book, albeit a flawed one.
                It addresses two currently important topics, microservices
                and containers, but only loosely justifies putting the two
                topics in the same work. It is divided into three sections, the
                first addressing microservices, the second containers, and the
                third 
            </p>

            <p>
                The first part of this book deals with microservices. In it,
                Kocher argues that for organizations with large, monolithic 
                applications, adopting a microservice approach could prove
                beneficial because:
            </p>

            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    They are simpler to understand than a monolithic application.
                </li>

                <li>
                    They are easier to scale: only the part of the overall
                    application that is the bottleneck needs to be 
                    given more resources.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It is easier to do continuous delivery when it is
                    microservices being updated, rather than an entire
                    monolithic application.
                </li>

                <li>
                    There will be looser coupling between components of the system
                    when it is built on microservices.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Bugs are isolated in a microservices and can't bring
                    down all components of a system.
                </li>

                <li>
                    They enable more freedom of choice among technologies,
                    as each microservice team can choose different languages,
                    libraries, databases, and so on.
                </li>


            </ul>

            <p>
                The connection between part one of the book, and part two,
                dealing with containers, and in particular Docker, is loose,
                and consists in little more than Kocher's assertion that 
                containers are a good way to run multiple microservices.
                Alternatives, like "serverless" computing in the cloud,
                are not examined. Nevertheless, the chapters on containers do
                provide a good overview of their use, why you might prefer them
                to virtuals machines (they use resources more efficiently), and
                why Docker is the most popular container implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of the container section, the author includes two
                chapters on "Container Orchestration" and 
                "Containers Management." These are very summaries of the 
                technical solutions available for deploying a suite of
                containers, each of which needs to be able to talk to all of
                the other containers, and for seeing how all of those
                containers are doing. 
                There are brief but serviceable sections on Mesos, Kubernetes,
                and Docker Swarm, all of which manage suites of containers.
                There is also a section on the important topic 
                of service discovery: with multiple containers spinning up
                and coming down all over your network of hundreds of
                microservices, how is a poor client machine supposed to know
                where to connect to what? The best solution, per this
                book, is to keep the knowledge in something like a load
                balancer, which fields requests for, say, user authentication,
                and knows where all the authentication servers are and which
                are busy, so it can route the client request to the
                best one.

            </p>

            <p>
                The editors of this book let the author down in many places,
                leaving in such clunkers as "becomes little complex" and "What
                would happen if the service... has error?"
                A more serious problem is that several contentions don't seem
                to make sense. For instance, the author writes, "Docker...
                addresses the deployment and scalability problems by separating
                applications from the info structure dependencies. It addresses
                these problems with containers, which allow us to package the
                application with all its dependencies." So Docker "separates"
                applications and their infrastructure dependencies by...
                packaging them together?
            
            </p>

            <p>
                Another annoying aspect of this book is the use of extensive
                screen dumps to pad out the material. For instance, the chapter
                on Docker commands consists of
                about half images of the output of Docker
                commands. A little of this sort of things is OK,
                but a little goes a long way, and
                the extensive use of these images here has gone way too far.
            </p>

            <p>
                In summary, if one is unfamiliar with microservices and/or
                containers, this book provides a decent introduction to 
                both topics. That being the case, with some better editing, 
                and a more robust link established between the two topics,
                this book could have gone from being a decent introduction to
                an excellent one.
