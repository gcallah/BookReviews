            <p>
            C. Bradley Thompson's <i>America's Revolutionary Mind</i>
                is intended as the first half
                of a study on the American founding: this volume focuses on the
                Declaration of Independence and the causes of the American
                Revolution, while the planned second volume will feature the
                United States Constitution. Thompson feels that the bi-partite
                division of these works, as well as their complementarity,
                reflects a fundamental reality about the United States: as he
                puts it, "The relationship between the current and the proposed
                volume is virtually identical to the connection that Abraham
                Lincoln saw between the Declaration of Independence and the
                Constitution" (xi).
            </p>

            <p>
            The first thing to note about this book is that it is <i>not</i>
            primarily a historical work, although it contains much historical
            research: instead, it is most essentially a promotional tract for a
            certain understanding of moral and political life.
            Thompson is a competent historian who certainly knows the source
            material of the revolutionary period extremely well. His
            description of the views of the revolutionaries seems accurate,
            and if what he had done was merely to lay out a history of those
            views in their development, this would be an excellent contribution
            to the historical literature. But running throughout the work is a
            constant subtext of advocacy: the views of the revolutionaries are
            not merely described, but it is continually implied that their
            understanding of human nature and politics was both entirely laudable
            and timelessly correct. 
            That this is primarily a polemical, rather than an historical, work
            is evidenced even in its arrangement, which is not chronological,
            but topological.
            Thus, in this review, I will only occasionally question Thompson‘s
            historical research; instead, I will focus more on the
            philosophical case he wishes his historical facts to support.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            In particular, Thompson repeatedly presents John Locke‘s ideas on
            government, rights, property, and revolution, as if they are a
            coherent, and a paradigm changing contribution to political
            philosophy.  For instance, Thompson claims "Locke is the first
            philosopher in history to make the individual the primary unit of
            moral and political value" (24), and
            obviously believes this to be a good thing. But Eric Voegelin
            penetrated the essence of what this attempt to remove the Christian
            substance from European civilization:
            </p>

            <p>
                "Locke and those who follow him in his course go on to live and
                to participate in a civilizational environment that has been
                formed into the remotest wrinkles of its intellectual language
                by the very tradition they try to remove. Hence, the attempt to
                return to the earlier phase will result not in a genuine
                removal of tradition (which would imply the rebuilding of a
                civilization on a new basis) but in a far-reaching devastation
                of the intellectual form of contemporary civilization."
                (https://voegelinview.com/lockes-reasonable-method/)
            </p>

            <p>
                Alongside such high praise from Thompson for Locke comes a good
                bit of praise for his own work.
                In the Preface Thompson tells us, "I have attempted to write a book
                that is original, comprehensive, and transformative" (xiii).
                Now, in my understanding of what an hitorical work should be
                aiming at, it would be to determine what actually happened in
                the past, and how what happened at some particular time
                followed from what happened at earlier times. Such a work may,
                in fact, <i>wind up</i> being "transformative,"
                but to set out with that goal in mind is, I
                suggest, a deformation of the character of historical research.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us consider Thompson's distress that
                the works of Bernard Bailyn and Gordon S. Wood from the late
                sixties remain the most important books for understanding the
                Revolution: "Surely, though, it should not remain the case that
                the most influential books on the American Revolution were
                written in the 1960s" (xii). Well, why not? Mathematicians never
                exhibit anxiety over the fact that the most influential
                understanding of the relationship of the sides of a right
                triangle was arrived at several thousand years ago. No, the
                Pythagorean Theorem is <i>correct</i>, and mathematicians
                accept that this is right (for Euclidean spaces)
                and build on that result. Perhaps it just happens to be the
                case that Bailyn and Wood "got things right" in the 1960s.
                And if they did <i>not</i> get things right,
                then certainly <i>how long ago</i> they made their mistakes is
                irrelevant. In fact, Thompson's concern about how "old" these
                works are seems to fly in the face of his repeated assertions
                that the American founders were espousing "timeless" truths. If
                their truths from the 1700s are not to be dismissed because
                they are "old," then why shoud the works of Bailyn and Woods
                suffer that fate?
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson goes on to contend that he has developed "a new
                approach to history writing that I shall call new moral
                history" (6). This approach, he says, "emphasizes thinking,
                judging, choosing, and acting individuals over large-scale
                social processes moved by unforeseen forces" (6). But to anyone
                who has studied the historiographical work of, say, Dilthey,
                Collingwood, Oakeshott, or Mises, this approach will hardly
                seem new. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson is full of praise for the Enlightenment. For example,
                he writes, "Newton's discoveries brought light where there had
                been only darkness" (15). Newton himself would have regarded
                Thompson's remark as nonsense:
                he famously acknowledged that he had made
                his discoveries only because he had stood on the "shoulders of
                giants." In a letter to David Gregory, he called the recent
                algebraic work of Descartes and others "the analysis of the
                bunglers in mathematics" and said that he himself looked back
                to the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians for
                inspiration. Further more, it has been demonstrated, by Duhem,
                Grant (1996), and others, that the foundations for the scientific
                advances of the seventeenth century were laid in the Middle
                Ages.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson further claims, "One thing was certain during the
                Enlightenment: faith, revelation, mystic insight, innate ideas,
                and a priori speculation were rejected" (16). But Newton
                himself spent more of his life studying scripture and alchemy
                than he did physics or mathematics, mathematics is built upon
                "a priori speculation," and that Descartes believed that
                "divine revelation is more certain than any knowledge" (1954).
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson is also enamored of Locke's idea of self ownership, paying no
                heed to the fact that it is nonsensical even with in the
                context of Locke's own philosophy. Locke suggests that one justly
                acquires ownership of some thing by mingling one’s own labor
                with it. And he even makes a logical step of admitting that
                this renders God the owner of everyone. Furthermore, for
                anyone who wishes to deny the existence of God, this would
                leave a person’s parents as a person’s rightful owner, since it
                was their "labor" they brought about that person. So Locke’s
                leap to then declare that people somehow "own themselves" makes
                no sense at all. Eric Voegelin's (1999) analysis of this incoherent
                jumble is worth quoting at some length:
            </p>

            <p>
            "[For Locke] God has made men; they are his property and they are
            under a duty to keep themselves alive and not to damage each other
            because any action of this kind would mean damage to God’s
            property. God is a serious person. He does not make men for fun; if
            he makes them he wants them to last as long as possible... If we
            inquire into the source of the rule that nobody must damage God’s
            property we are referred to God, Nature, Reason, and Common Equity;
            none of these sources is defined or explained in any way
            whatsoever...
            </p>

            <p>
            "The rule of doing no damage has nothing to do with reason, nature,
            or other hieroglyphs, but has for its source the ethical
            conventions of Locke and of the society of which he is the
            respected representative. Man is a proprietor who watches over his
            own property and recognizes his duty not to damage anybody else’s,
            and God is formed in his image... For... Locke, he is a
            manufacturer who does not want his property to be damaged...
            </p>

            <p>
            "Whether God is a proprietor or not, what really matters is that
            man is a proprietor of himself. No pretext of derivation is made
            for the second step; man simply has 'a property in his own person'"
            (146-147)
            </p>


            <p>
                The point here is not to argue that "timeless truths" do not exist.
                Instead, it is that Locke’s philosophy isn’t the right place to
                look for them, since his philosophy is not even internally
                consistent.
            </p>

            <p>
            Thompson devotes an entire chapter to slavery.
            Faced with reconciling the founders belief that all men are created
            equal with the fact that many of them owned slaves, Thompson writes
            that we must "examine the ideas, decisions, and actions of
            America's revolutionary generation on the founders' own terms"
            (128). But, this looks like the "historicism" that Thompson
            roundly condemns in other parts of this very book! It seems
            historicism is good when it reaches conclusions Thompson likes, but
            bad when it doesn't.
            </p>

            <p>
            On this topic, Thompson is simply wrong in his historical
            facts when he writes:
            "With the possible exception of the Quakers, few Americans (or
            anyone anywhere else for that matter) before the 1760s seriously
            questioned the moral status of slavery" (125).
            </p>

            <p>
            This is nonsense: there had been Catholic abolition movements since
            the 5th century, and a Papal bull condemning slavery had been
            issued just two decades before the 1760s. However, since these
            facts do not fit with Thompson's narrative that before the
            Enlightenment all was medieval darkness, they are conveniently
            ignored.
            </p>

            <p>
            A few pages later, Thompson writes:
            "Day-to-day life for ordinary people in seventeenth- and
            eighteenth-century Anglo-American society could be described as, to
            quote Thomas Hobbes, 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'"
            (128).
            </p>

            <p>
            It is hard to imagine what the point of quoting Hobbes here is,
            since his famous phrase is a description of what he thought life
            would be like <i>outside</i> of society. Hobbes wished to
            <i>contrast</i> this state with life in English society, at least
            when it was not in a state of civil war: within society, life was
            <i>no longer</i> "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"!
            </p>

            <p>
            Thompson goes on to consider the idea of "rights." He
            asserts that
            "Eighteenth-century Americans took for granted that all men
            everywhere have natural rights... The rights of nature are
            indefeasible, inherent, universal, eternal, and absolute" (164)
            Now, it may be true that they had 
            "taken this for granted" as an abstraction, but as
            soon as it came time to deal with concrete matters, the country was
            riven by acrimonious disputes: federalists versus
            anti-federalists, the Whiskey Rebellion,
            Jefferson versus Hamilton, the Alien and Sedition Acts and the
            opposition to them,
            the Federalists versus the Democratic-Republicans, 
            New England versus Jefferson's tariffs, and so on. There was
            agreement on fine-sounding, vague ideas, and little agreement on
            what these meant in practice.
            </p>

            <p>
            Soon thereafter, Thompson says that, for the revolutionaries,
            "to have property in one’s rights is to say that each and every
            individual has sovereignty over his choices and conduct within the
            limits agreed to by all individuals in a particular society” (167).
            </p>

            <p>
            This is striking firstly because, just a few pages before, rights were
            "absolute," but now they only extend to the "limits" agreed to by
            "all individuals" in some society. And in that last phrase is the second
            surprising contention: no society has ever existed anywhere in which "all
            individuals" agreed to what those limits should be.
            </p>

            <p>
            Thompson quotes the Reverend Dan Foster as claiming "if anything in
            nature is capable of proof [the basic rights of nature] are capable
            to be proved, and of being set in a most convincing and clear point
            of light before all reasonable and impartial minds” (170).
            </p>

            <p>
            But a multitude of people have gone about trying to "prove" what such
            rights imply about a political system, and, unlike geometricians,
            they keep reaching different conclusions. The only way to defend
            Foster's conclusion is to declare that one can detect a "reasonable
            and impartial mind" based on whether a person arrives at the same
            theory of rights as oneself.
            </p>

            <p>
            As MacIntyre noted in <i>Whose Justice? Which Rationality?</i>,
            "the history of attempts to construct a
            morality for tradition-free individuals, whether by an appeal to
            one out of several conceptions of universalizability or to one out
            of equally multifarious conceptions of utility or to shared
            intuitions or to some combination of these, has its outcome... been
            a history of continuously unresolved disputes” (334)
            </p>

            <p>
            When it comes to the ownership of private property, Thompson
            enthusiastically embraces Locke's proposal that one comes to own
            property by "mixing" one's labor with it. That the idea of "mixing"
            labor with objects is a very strange way of thinking has been noted
            before -- see Nozick (1974) or Waldron (1983). The latter notes that
            the very idea of mixing labor with objects appears to be a category
            error: I can mix eggs and flour, since both are objects. But how
            can I mix labor, which is an action, with, say, wood, which is an
            object? <i>Using</i> my labor, I might mix wood with some plastics
            to form a wood composite, but in how does it make sense to say my
            labor is contained in the mix? If I created this mixture taking
            advantage of the fact that it was a hot day that allowed me to mix
            the plastic more thoroughly with the wood, is the heat of the day
            also now part of this mixture?
            </p>

            <p>
            And Nozick asks us to consider that,
            even if we grant that it makes sense to say one can "mix"
            labor with an object, it is not clear why this should give the
            mixer ownership of the object. If I take some jewelry I own, and I
            "mix" it with the ocean by tossing it in the waves,
            almost everyone would
            think I had <i>thrown away</i> my jewelry, not that I had suddenly
            gained ownership of the ocean. Why should things be different with
            my labor?
            </p>

            <p>
            A simple way of trying to make sense of Locke is to posit that he
            really meant, "If you made it, you own it." But then why not say
            that? Well, what perhaps Locke really seeks to justify is the
            ownership of <i>land</i>, the most important thing owned by most
            people when he wrote. And in particular, why do various Englishmen
            own vast tracts of land in North America, when there
            were people there before them who seemingly ought to be the just
            owners? Of course, on occasion, the settlers had "purchased" the
            land from an Indian tribe, but given that the North American
            Indians did not share European ideas of land ownership (Bailyn,
            2013), then even such purchases are of questionable provenance.
            And in many other cases, land was simply "granted" to some European
            without any concern about the Indians who lived on it: consider the
            grant to William Penn of the entire state of Pennsylvania.

            Thompson next considers the idea that a government is only
            legitimate if it has the unanimous consent of the governed.
            He cites Thomas Paine, whom
            he praises for finally having gone all the way and recommending
            severing the colonies ties with Britain. He describes how Paine
            makes a sharp distinction between "society" and "government."  
            Society is good and government is just a necessary evil. The
            "natural society" or Locke’s state of nature, is supposed to
            describe the "actual conditions on the ground" (251) in the
            American colonies. But, in fact, the colonists on their arrival
            had encountered societies with much less formal government than
            even the colonists themselves established. And such societies
            hardly conform to Thompson‘s libertarian ideals. As noted above,
            the American Indians did not even have a concept of land ownership.
            And rather than a pure private property regime, we find that such
            pre-state societies typically have serious communal restraints on
            private appropriation, for instance, there is a customary way in
            which the spoils of a hunt should be divided, rather than going
            entirely to the hunter who "mixed his labor" with a deer or bison.

            <p>
            Thompson next takes up the topic of when revolution is justified.
            Given his endorsement of the idea that, for a government to be
            legitimate, consent to it must be "unanimous," it is worth
            examining a few actual incidents that he describes.
            </p>

            <p>
            The residents of rural western Massachusetts in 1775 announced that
            they preferred to be without any government rather than to submit
            to the king or the non-constitutional government then effectively
            ruling Massachusetts. The eastern, establishment revolutionaries
            enlisted a resident of the west to inform his fellow westerners
            that "the inhabitants of Berkshire County were still obliged 'to
            obey the rules, and orders prescribed by the major part of the
            society'" (261). In western New Hampshire, rebellious river
            towns declared that they did not want to be part of the new
            revolutionary state of New Hampshire. A member of the state council
            pointed out to them that some portion of their population wish to
            remain connected to the state of New Hampshire. "How and why, he
            asked, will these minorities be compelled to obey the majorities of
            their tiny town republics?"(262)
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Well, we know how the many American
            loyalists were compelled to obey the revolutionaries: they were
            sometimes tarred and feathered, or had their houses burned, and
            many  fled to Canada or the Caribbean. Thompson takes no note of
            the fact that this makes nonsense of the idea that the leading
            revolutionaries thought that the only legitimate government was one
            that had the consent of the governed. <i>They</i> did not want to be
            governed  without their consent, but they were perfectly happy
            to force the government they wanted upon some yokels in western
            Massachusetts, or upon American loyalists.  
            </p>

            <p>
            In fact, once we take account of the 20% or so of colonists who
            were still loyal to the crown, the 25% of the population that were
            black slaves, the 50% of the population who were women with no
            vote, the many propertyless white males who had no vote, and the
            American Indians still resident within the colonies, it is quite
            clear that this was the revolt of an elite, who wanted a government
            that they liked, and did not particularly care whether all of the
            above groups consented to it, or not. Thompson states that the
            revolutionaries believe that consent "must be unanimous" (268):
            but once we total up the members of all of the above groups, it is
            clear that the new, revolutionary government, was, in fact,
            consented to by only a small minority of the adult population of
            the thirteen colonies.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the last part of this book, Thompson takes on what he calls
            "historicism," an error to which both the defenders of slavery and
            20th-century progressives fell prey.
            Firstly, I will note that, while I am neither a defender of slavery
            nor a progressive: this is an ugly attempt at smear
            by association. It is akin to noting that, "Well, Hitler was a
            vegetarian, and my opponent Joe Smith is a vegetarian, so
            therefore..."
            </p>
            
            <p>
            On this topic, Thompson creates a false dichotomy:
            either someone ignores historical circumstances and accepts
            "timeless" values, or they are an unprincipled "relativist,"
            thinking that there are no standards of right and wrong, only
            whatever some particular society happens to regard as right or
            wrong. That this dichotomy is false can be illustrated with a
            simple analogy: let's say I want to travel from Hawaii to Easter
            Island by the fastest means possible? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, if I lived in Hawaii in 1200 A.D., the fastes means would
                have been by catamaran. But today, a jet plane can surely get
                me there faster. Does that mean that "the truth" about the
                fastest means is relative? Of course not: catamaran <i>really
                was</i> the fastest means in 1200, and jet plane <i>really
                is</i> the fastest means today. In 1200, someone who suggested
                "walking" as the fastest means from Hawaii to Easter Island
                would have been objectively wrong, just as today someone
                recommending "catamaran" would be objectively wrong. And in the
                future, when we have constructed hyper-space tunnels, the
                answer "jet plane" will be objectively wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
                In fact, it is <i>only</i> by considering historical
                circumstances that we can really, objectively determine what
                would have been the best action <i>available to an actor</i> in
                the circumstances in which they found themselves. If we want to
                criticize the Polynesians for traveling for Easter Island by
                catamaran, the only coherent way to do so is by pointing out
                that, in their actual, historical circumstances, they in fact
                had a better alternative. It is ridiculous to argue, "These
                Polynesian explorers were fools: why didn't they just take a
                jet plane?" when there were no jet planes available to them.
                As Claes Ryn (1997) puts it:
            </p>

            <p>
            "Contemporary critics of 'historicism,' as exemplified by Leo
            Strauss, do not delve very deeply into German philosophy… What is
            criticized as 'historicism' — and emphasis on history that tends to
            undermine universality — is only one possible offshoot of German
            historicist philosophy... to those arbitrarily assuming that
            historicism must destroy universality, talk of the historical
            nature of thought, or a human life more generally, seems a threat
            to the idea of truth (and the idea of moral right). But you insist
            that we are forever trying to clarify our insights into reality and
            that we must do so within the more or less favorable intellectual
            and other circumstances which are our own life is most certainly
            <i>not</i> the same as to dissolve philosophy into a sea of historical
            relativity." (126)
            </p>

            <p>
            Thompson has written a curious book: a work of political persuasion
            disguised as a history book. He makes a convincing case that many
            of the founders were the Lockean rationalists he says they were. 
            But his implicit case that Lockean rationalism is <i>true</i>
            fails; and the reason for that is that it is false; in fact,
            timelessly false.
