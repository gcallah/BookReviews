                Princeton University Press,

            One way of defining "rationalism," the modern tendency critiqued by
            such figures as Michael Oakeshott, F.A. Hayek, and Michael Polanyi,
            is that it is the attempt to replace experience by technique. In
            his important new book, historian Jerry Muller takes on a
            particular species of rationalism: our modern fixation on replacing
            expert judgment with a sort of rule by quantifiable entities.

            This book has a target, which Muller calls "metric fixation."
            Muller's critique of metric fixation overlaps my work on
            rationalism, as shown by his statement of one of the "key
            components" of metric fixation: "the belief that it is possible and
            desirable to replace judgment, acquired by personal experience and
            talent, with numerical indicators of comparative performance based
            upon standardized data (metrics)" (p. 18).
