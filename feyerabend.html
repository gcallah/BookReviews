                "The assumption that humans of the Stone or Bronze Age would 
                have had only the most primitive knowledge of nature may be
                flattering to our progressivist self-image. But it has little
                plausibility since Stone Age humans were already fully
                developed members of the species <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and it is
                incompatible with recent research. The environmental and societal
                problems that the early <i>Homo sapiens</i> had to face were
                incomparably greater than the challenges facing our contemporary
                scientists. These problems has to be solved with the most
                primitive means, often without any division of labor or
                specialized skills, and the solutions arrived at indicate a
                level of intelligence and sensitivity that is clearly not inferior
                to ours." -- pp. 5-6

                "An animated world, divine intervention, 
                the 'openness' of the soul's life are
                not preconceptions or errors or 
                results of a superficial approach, but clearly
                recognizable components of this experience 
                of the world, and their elimination
                constitutes an elimination of important knowledge." -- p. 90

                "Thus, Anaximander's universe and its later modifications are
                uniform. <em>And yet they are not complete.</em> They do not contain
                mythological events, dreams or spawns of imagination... We push
                the events in question out of our physical world and into
                another world, which is conceived of either as a world
                consisting entirely of appearance, of non-reality, or as a very
                real yet non-physical worldâ€¦ In both cases we obtain an
                antiseptic real (physical) world at the expense of
                insurmountable problems: how can we reunify domains that are so
                radically separate? Increased specialization makes the problems
                disappear from the researchers' horizon, which only strengthens
                said researchers conviction that their professional ideology is
                indeed capable of successfully overcoming <em>all</em>
                difficulties." -- pp. 126-132.
