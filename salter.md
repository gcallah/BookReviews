Alexander Salter has written an important book, examining how the political program of distributism can inform
contemporary debates about political economy. The fact that Salter is a trained economist with a PhD is significant,
since it indicates that taking distributism seriously might be simply a symptom of ignorance of
"scientific" economics.

Despite Salter's sympathy with distributist thought, he never gives the architects of distributism (chiefly G.K.
Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc) a free pass: he continually tests whether their ideas appear plausible given commonly
accepted economic theory.


"Man needs not just a shelter but a *home*, and socialism cannot distinguish between the two." (92)


Chesterton sees the battle between Tories and socialists as little more than a pantomime, disguising the awful
possibility that they are "secretly in partnership; the quarrel they keep up in public is very much of a put-up job; and
that the way in which they perpetually play into each other's hands is not an everlasting coincidence (92-93)

"It never seems to strike these people, that the lesson of lice in the slums of the wrongness of slums, not the
wrongness of hair." (93)


Salter spend some time discussing Mary Hirschfeld's work *Aquinas and the Market*. Her spell notes that well economics
discusses efficiency, in terms of what means unemployed to achieve any ends whatsoever, Aquinas holes that "human choice
is not about efficiently getting what we want so much as it is about learning how to want what is genuinely good" (144,
Salter quoting Hirshfeld). There is no virtue in being very efficient about achieving evil ends. Salter contends that
while Hirshfeld's work points us towards a humane *economics*, Belloc and Chesterton's program is about creating a
humane *economy*. Thus, Salter concludes, these are two complementary research programs that should be united.


As someone who has repeatedly committed the venial sin of reviewing academic books, I find too many academic writers
seem to believe that the best way of showing one's intelligence is to write obscurely. Salter does not suffer from that
illusion: his writing is always pellucid. A minor quibble: Salter does employ the contemporary, nearly instinctual habit
of announcing in advance or retrospectively repeating one's main argument. At one point he writes, "It will be helpful
to summarize the arguments thus far" (127). My reaction was, "Not really: I have been following along." I cannot recall
a single classic work of philosophy, social theory, or history that follows this method: I think it is a journalistic
trick appropriate for casual readers of newspapers that has unfortunately leaked into academic writing.

Title: A Thought-Provoking Exploration of Distributism: The Political Economy of Distributism by Alexander William Salter

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Alexander William Salter's The Political Economy of Distributism delves into a traditionally overlooked yet deeply
significant economic system known as distributism. With insightful analysis and a well-researched approach, Salter
offers readers a comprehensive understanding of distributism and its potential to address contemporary socio-economic
challenges.

From the beginning, Salter sets the stage by describing and contextualizing distributism within the broad spectrum of
economic ideologies, juxtaposing it against capitalism and socialism. This background lays a solid foundation for
readers unfamiliar with distributism, allowing them to appreciate its principles and objectives effectively.

The strength of this book lies in Salter's ability to present distributism as a unique alternative, promoting widespread
ownership of means of production through small-scale businesses and decentralized control. He elucidates how
distributism strives to strike a balance between the efficiencies of markets and the need for sustainable and inclusive
economic development.

Salter effectively highlights the historical evolution of distributism, tracing its intellectual roots to influential
thinkers such as G.K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, and others. Drawing upon their writings and incorporating his own
analysis, Salter presents a compelling argument for distributism's potential to offer an equitable and morally conscious
economic system.

One of the book's notable strengths is Salter's dedication to addressing potential criticisms. He acknowledges the
challenges that distributism may face, both in theory and practice, and offers insightful counterarguments. By doing so,
he ensures that readers engage with a thorough and nuanced assessment of the viability and limitations of this economic
model.

The book's prose is commendable, striking a balance between accessibility and academic rigor. Salter demonstrates his
expertise through complex economic discussions without alienating non-specialist readers. The clarity of his writing
ensures that the book remains accessible to a broad audience interested in contemporary economic debates.

However, there are moments when The Political Economy of Distributism becomes overly technical, delving into intricate
economic theories and jargon. While this may be enticing for economists and scholars, it may hinder the book's
accessibility to readers without a strong background in the field.

Nonetheless, Salter's persuasive analysis of distributism's potential benefits, such as reducing income inequality,
preserving local communities, and promoting stable growth, makes a strong case for its consideration as a plausible
alternative to prevailing economic systems.

In conclusion, The Political Economy of Distributism is a thought-provoking exploration of a relatively unexplored
economic ideology. Salter's expertise and dedication to the subject are evident throughout the book, challenging readers
to critically examine the strengths and limitations of distributism. For those seeking an alternative economic framework
that prioritizes justice, inclusivity, and sustainability, this book is a valuable resource.
