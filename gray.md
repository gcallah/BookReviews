Reviewing one of John Gray's recent books is an adventurous undertaking. 



As someone who has read Michael Oakeshott, one would think that Gray would be more careful to distinguish the
presuppositions of a theory from the discoveries made using it. to the contrary, he writes:

"Here Fukuyama departs from the most important discovery in modern science. As understood by Charles Darwin, evolution
has no destination." (20)

But this is not something Darwin "discovered": how could it be? We would need a perspective looking backward from the
end of time to "discover" whether evolution has a destination. What Darwin did was pre-suppose that evolution proceeds
via random mutations, and then tried to see if he could explain the origin of species using that presupposition. The
fact that his theory does not contain a telos for evolution is hardly surprising, since that was an assumption fed in
in order to formulate the theory.

Gray follows this up by claiming, "Natural selection of genes is a purposeless process that is going nowhere." (20)
His statement of this, as a Balde fact is particularly surprising, given two later statements he makes in this same
book. At one point, he admits that "The accidental origins of Christianity, of course, prove nothing. For a believer,
chance is the work of providence." (124) (Of course, this would be better stated as, "For the believer, what may appear
to us as chance is actually the workings of an infinite mind.") So the fact that John Gray sees no purpose to evolution
hardly shows that it has no purpose. And in another passage, Gray notes that "


Mass immigration...  Gray quotes Ryszard Kapuscinski:

"One of the goals of these operations is to create the uprooted man, wrenched from his culture, from his surroundings
and landscape, and therefore more defenseless and obedient vis-à-vis the dictates of the regime." (34)


"Verkhovensky represents a type of intellectual familiar the world over. Recycling the fashionable detritus that
millions like him unthinkingly believe, he is convinced of his independence of mind." — John Gray

"Lenin and Stalin aimed to remake human beings on a new model. The Leviathan they created bred an elite of Hobbesian
survivors, then killed them." (83)

"The psychology of the political believer is not confined interwar communists and fellow travelers. The same mixture of
self deception and adamant certainty can be observed in post-Cold War liberals. They, too, cannot admit the demise of
the faith that has given meaning to their lives." (102)

"sex workers" (105)


Gray begins a chapter called "Mortal gods" by noting:

"Liberalism was a creation of Western monotheism and liberal freedoms part of the civilization that monotheism
engendered. Twenty-first-century liberals reject this civilization, while continuing to assert the universal authority of a
hollowed-out version of its values. In this hyper-liberal vision all societies are destined to undergo the
deconstruction that is underway in the West." (109)

Passages like this show Gray at his best, as a sharp critic of contemporary, thoughtlessly assumed verities.


"Human beings can never be wholly self-defined." (109)



## Woke-ism

"The origins of what has come to be called the woke movement are in the decay of liberalism." (110)

It is a "vehicle through with surplus elites struggle to secure a position of power in society." (110)

"Country to its right wing critics, woke thinking is not a variety of Marxism. No woke ideologue comes anywhere close to
Karl Marx in rigour, breadth and depth of thought." (111)

"Once questions of identity become central in politics, conflicts of economic interest can be disregarded. Idle
chatter of micro-aggression screens out class hierarchy and the abandonment of large sections of society to idleness
and destitution." (111)

"In their economic aspects, woke movements are a revolt of the professional bourgeoisie." (111)



## Populism

"populism... has no clear meaning, but it is used by liberals to refer to political blowback against the social disruption
produced by their own policies." (133)


"Human beings repress their awareness of death by identifying themselves with a supposedly timeless idea or belief..."
(147). Is Gray really unaware of the tradition of _Memento Mori_ practiced in Christianity, or the countless skulls
found in Indian and Tibetan art?


Given the style of the work, it is often hard to say when Gray is presenting "something interesting to think about" and
when he is presenting "here's what I think."


Gray's works, in spite of his own views, show the importance of faith. He is an intelligent and perceptive observer of
"the world of the flesh," and is honest enough that he cannot hide from its ultimate meaninglessness (without
illumination by the world of the spirit). The result, as Gray so ably shows, is bleak.
