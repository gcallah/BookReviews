            <p>
            Bas van Bavel has produced an important historical study, one
            highly relevant to current debates on economic policy.
            The context in which this
            work is set is the ongoing debate over optimal economic policy. For
            a time, from the collapse of the Soviet Union until about a decade
            ago, it seemed that this debate might be settled: neoliberalism had
            triumphed, and the best political economy prescription clearly
            involved a heavy dose of free markets. Certainly, there was debate
            at the margins: Should healthcare be publicly provisioned? How big
            a welfare state should one have? What is the proper role for
            central banks and international economic institutions like the IMF?
            </p>

            <p>
            But then came the financial crisis of 2007-2008, and all that had
            seemed settled was at play again. The response to the crisis by
            free-market advocates most typically ran along these lines: "Yes,
            the crisis was bad, but it was the result of crony capitalism, not
            of true free markets. If the central banks and the international
            economic institutions had not gotten in bed with the big banks,
            this all could have been avoided." 
            </p>

            <p>
            But van Bavel's work provides a very important counter-response.
            Van Bavel's main thesis is that free factor
            markets work well, for a time,
            at producing wealth and lifting all boats. But with the rise of
            factor markets, meaning market dominance over the allocation of
            land, labor, and capital, there arises an increasingly wealthy
            financial elite.  As van Bavel puts it, 
            "the rise and dominance of markets for land, labour, and capital
            are self-undermining, as... feedback mechanisms results in welfare
            declining again and markets losing their quality in facilitating
            successful and rapid exchange..." (pg. 2)
            </p>

            <p>
            Van Bavel backs his thesis with extensive evidence from three case
            studies: Iraq between 500 and 1100 CE, Northern Italy from 1000 to
            1500, and the Low Countries between 1100 and 1800. He also touches,
            much more lightly, upon other instances of market societies, such
            as England, the United States, early modern China, and the Roman
            Empire.

            <p>
            After assembling a wealth of historical material, van Bavel claims:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
            The three main cases analyzed in the book, and also the
            three modern cases that
            are more tentatively discussed, show a similar
            pattern in the interaction of
            society, market institutions, and economy.
            In this pattern, an originally
            positive feedback cycle -- between increasing freedom,
            growing factor markets,
            and economic growth -- turns into a negative one,
            with the increasing social
            polarization, institutional sclerosis, markets
            that become increasingly skewed
            towards the interests of market elites,
            and economic growth stagnating and
            turning into relative or absolute decline. (251)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
            An important factor
            in the initially favorable results was that
            non-elite actors "had access to alternative
            mechanisms of exchange outside the
            market and therefore were free to choose
            whether to use factor markets or not"
            (253). (Such mechanisms included guilds,
            strong family institutions, barter exchange, and production for
            home consumption from one's own land.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
            But as factor markets began to eliminate such
            alternatives, often through
            "outright attacks" (254) on them -- e.g.,
            enclosure laws, or anti-guild
            legislation -- "wealth inequality rose to high,
            or even unprecedented levels"
            (255). To preserve their wealth, the
            new elites "tied it up in family
            foundations, religious foundation, or fiduciary entails" (258-259).
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Van Bavel offers a number of reasons for
            this result, e.g., "the wealthy
            usually have more access to information
            or legal expertise. With the growing
            scale and complexity of markets, the
            advantage this offers them also grows"
            (263). 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The moral principles that market advocates
            often posit as counter-balances to
            the rise of crony capitalism are also
            ruled out in van Bavel's analysis, as traditional norms and
            institutions see their power sapped by the market.
            Van Bavel contends that late-cycle reform forces will
            fail, due to the increasing political power of financial elites.
            In the last phase of the cycle, he finds "growing state repression,
            armed violence, and warfare by state and public authorities..."
            (268)
            </p>

            <p>
            A brief review such as this cannot do justice to wealth of material
            in this important new book, other than by noting that anyone
            interested in these issues should not miss it.
