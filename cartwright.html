                Cartwright casually mentions the idea that singular
                causation is actually the fundament, but dismisses it
                in favor of a "general to specific" (19) approach.
                However, it is hard to see how we could
                ever formulate causal generalities without first
                understanding singular causes.
                <br />
                Cartwright defends the notion of causation in singular cases
                against those who contend that only a statistical study on a
                large sample can produce robust evidence of causation. She
                holds that we can detect single causes much as we detect causes
                in a large study, as exhibitions of law-like regularities.

                Bueno and Neiman contend that evidence does not and should not
                depend on the beliefs of the person evaluating the evidence.
                One would have thought that Michael Polanyi's work would have
                put an end to such silliness long ago: evidence is always
                evidence <i>to</i> someone, and whether it counts as evidence
                will depend upon their beliefs.
