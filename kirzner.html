                Israel M. Kirzner is the dean of the "Austrian school" of
                economics. (I use scare quotes only because some, even some
                called "Austrian," dispute there is such a school, often
                contending that it has been absorbed into the mainstream.) Over
                six decades he has produced a stream of papers and books
                defending and extending the insights into the market process
                achieved by his mentors Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek.

				"The model cannot be used to 'explain' market prices; the model
                presumes that everyone has, somehow, correctly and
                self-fulfilling guessed what the market price is going to be.
                The circumstance that (quite apart from the assumed correctness
                of the anticipated price) the model treats each market
                participant as a price-taker further underscores the
                uselessness of the model as an explanation for the manner in
                which prices are adjusted. No one in the model ever does change
                his price bids or offers." -- p. 52

            </p>

            <p>
            In "Knowledge Problems and Their Solutions," Kirzner makes the
            important distinction between type A and type B knowledge problems.
            </p>

            <p>
            Type A problems involve undue optimism, and are self-correcting: if
            I think I can sell my programming services for $1 million per hour,
            I surely will be disappointed, and, if wise, I will lower my price.
            My very attempt to act on my over-optimistic beliefs reveals their
            falsity.
            </p>

            <p>
            Type B problems, on the other hand, involve undue pessimism, and
            are not self-correcting. I may believe that my current boss, who is
            paying me $50 per hour, is the best employer I can find. But,
            unbeknownst to me, just down the block is someone who would happily
            pay me $100 per hour, if he knew of my existence. And I would
            happily go work for him, if I knew of his. For type B problems to
            be "corrected" requires entrepreneurial action, perhaps, say, a job
            placement firm that will alert both the potential new employer and
            me to each other's presence in the market, for a fee.
            </p>

            <p>
            The broader theme under discussion in this essay is to what extent
            Hayek's move from confidence in the error-correcting properties of
            markets to the error-correcting properties of "social evolution" is
            justified. Kirzner argues that Hayek is on solid ground in
            believing that spontaneous social processes  ill correct type A
            errors, but on much shakier ground if he wishes to contend (and
            perhaps it is not clear that he does so wish to contend) that such
            social processes can correct type B errors. And the reason for
            this, Kirzner contends, is that the correction of type B errors in
            the market depend upon the lure of entrepreneurial profit, while no
            similar attractant exists in non-market social contexts.
            </p>

            <p>
            Hayek cites the evolution of law, language, and money as examples
            of spontaneous social processes: let us grant, for the moment, that
            he is correct about this, something Kirzner is willing to do. But,
            Kirzner contends, such processes exhibit that social agents can
            spontaneously correct type A problems in non-market settings, and,
            at the best, that their self-interested actions might accidentally
            correct a type B problem. (And Kirzner notes the many cases in
            which spontaneous social processes might create an ever-worsening
            situation, such as those highlighted in the work of Thomas
            Schelling.) He offers an analysis of the Mengerian story of the
            evolution of a medium of exchange as an example: the
            entrepreneurial alertness to trade for a more liquid commodity,
            even if it is not the one ultimately wants to consume, "is never
            alertness to prospects of further increasing that liquidity... No
            entrepreneur could, by himself, discover opportunities for pure
            profit by attempting to move the barter society towards the use of
            money" (p. 102). But... why couldn't he? Whether or not any such
            thing ever actually happened, isn't it conceivable that some
            entrepreneur saw, say, silver being traded more-and-more, and so
            decided to become a market-maker in silver, so as to facilitate
            further increases in the liquidity of silver, to his own profit?
            </p>

            <p>
                But certainly Kirzner is correct in stating that there is "no
                basis for any extension of the welfare theorems relating to
                markets to hte broader field of the theory of institutional
                evolution. The explanation for such benign tendencies, if
                indeed they exist, must be sought elsewhere" (p. 103).
            </p>

            <p>
            </p>

            <p>
            </p>

            <p>
            However, in discussing this distinction further with a friend, I
            wonder if Type B problems are really as little susceptible to
            self-correction as Kirzner contends. For, in that conversation, I
            began to provide an example of putting one's house on the market
            for too low a price. But as I did so, I realized that such an error
            is pretty much self-correcting: if I put my house on the market for
            (significantly) too low a price, on the date of the first open
            house showing, I will be flooded with potential buyers, and it will
            be obvious to me that I have been overly pessimistic about the
            price the house can fetch. Similarly, if I own a grocery, and I ask
            too low a price for my milk, I will run out of milk very fast.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the converse case, if I pessimistically believe that I must bid
            too much for a resource -- for instance, if I have started up a new
            tech company, and believe I must bid at least $300,000 to attract
            decent software engineers -- I may be quickly informed of my
            mistake because I am absolutely flooded with software engineers
            applying for my open positions.
            </p>

            <p>
            So it seems to me that Kirzner's analysis of undue pessimism is not
            universal, but applies only to the cases where there are relatively
            few buyers or sellers of a commodity, so that an unduly low bid or
            ask price is not immediately revealed by a flood of sellers or
            buyers.
            </p>

            <p>
            But does this analysis perhaps not also undermine Kirzner's
            analysis of undue optimism? For if there are very few buyers or
            sellers in a market, could it not be the case that my asking price
            for, say, my house, is perfectly fine, and that the fact I have not
            sold it is simply the result of my not having waited long enough
            for the buyer, for whom mine is the perfect property, to come
            along?
            </p>


            <p>
                "Since individuals obviously differ in their entrepreneurial
                alertness, it is clear that opportunities for social
                improvement will tend to be exploited most fruitfully if
                institutional arrangements can be patterned so as to translate
                such opportunities into opportunities that will be encountered
                by those whose entrepreneurial alertness is the most acute, the
                most sensitive, and the most accurate." ("Knowing about
                Knowledge," <i>Competition, Economic Planning, and the
                Knowledge Problem</i>, p. 216)
            </p>

            <p>
                But what entrepreneurial alertness is alert <i>to</i>, per
                Kirzner, is <i>profit</i> opportunities, not "opportunities for
                social improvement." Now, one could protest that those
                opportunities are the same thing, but then what about an
                entrepreneur who is alert to the fact that the Internet offers
                a "better" way to deliver rape-fantasy videos to those who are
                titillated by the idea of raping women, or alert to the
                possibility of creating a new, far more addictive form of
                opiate that will yield huge profits to its creator? A hedonist
                utilitarian <i>might</i> be able to make a case that these are
                "social improvements": if these innovations are desired by
                those who consume them, then all is well! However, Kirzner is
                an orthodox rabbi, and it is hard for me to believe that he
                would really see them as such. But if he would not, then what
                happens to his case for maximally releasing entrepreneurial
                alertness, given that profit opportunities are <i>not</i> equal
                to opportunities for social improvement?
            </p>



            <p>
                Questionable:
            </p>


            <p>
            Kirzner follows the passage above with one defending the social
            utility of advertising:
            </p>

            <p>
                "If the advertiser projects his message to the potential
                consumer in color, or with comic illustration, or accompanied
                by a certain piece of music, surely this is because the
                advertiser knows not merely how to lower the cost to the
                consumer of learning his message, but how to encourage
                spontaneous learning by the consumer with no deliberate search
                at all." (p. 217)
            </p>
