# The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order: America and the World in the Free
Market Era

Gary Gerstle has written an infuriating book: infuriating because its core is
an excellent and enlightening narrative of the rise and fall of what he terms
"the Neoliberal Order," so that I want to sing its praises; but, unfortunately,
Gerstle's ideological commitments have repeatedly intruded themselves into the
narrative, so that what would have been an exemplary history is marred by
numerous factual errors and provocative claims for which he provides no
backing.

The basic thesis of this book is that there exist political orders, by
which the author means to designate "A constellation of ideologies, policies,
and constituencies..." (2). Gerstle contends that, in the US,
there have been two such orders in living memory: the New Deal Order, and the
Neoliberal Order. And I think his claim here is on sound ground.

Unfortunately, he then makes his first factual misstep, when he writes: 
"Steve Fraser and I introduced the concept of political order in a 1989 book
that we co-edited..." (3) Unfortunately for this claim, Eric Voegelin wrote a
five-volume series, *Order and History*, from 1956 through 1987, devoted to the
topic of political orders. I grant that Voegelin did not conceive of such
orders in precisely the same way as Fraser and Gerstle, nevertheless, his
formulation is similar enough to theirs that he ought to be granted "first
discoverer" status.


"The ethnonationalist leaders, Trump included... wanted the planet to be
governed by force rather than by international law and multinational
nongovernmental organizations..." (277)

OK, by what possible "international law" could multinational, non-governmental
organizations "govern the planet"? But it gets even worse: Gerstle goes on to
say that Trump was making real a vision of a future in which the US would
withdraw from its "role its role as the world’s global policeman, and from its
responsibility as the enforcer of liberal and neoliberal rules of global
order."

In other words, the world Gerstle liked *was* being ruled by force: US force
attacking countries that did not conform to rules of the global order created by
the US and its allies. (See, for instance, Iraq, 2003.)
And when he complains that Trump wanted a global order
ruled by force, what he really means is that Trump was threatening to stop
ruling the globe by force!


"Suddenly, and for the first moment in the nation's petroleum age, Americans
could not get enough gasoline."  (60)

This is economic nonsense: there is no amount of some commodity that is
"enough" independent of its price. At lower prices, people will demand a
greater quantity of a product, and at higher prices, they will demand a smaller
one. If the price of gasoline had been allowed to rise to reflect the OPEC
restrictions, Americans would’ve had just as much gasoline as they wished to
use at that cost.


Gerstle gives credit (or places the blame?) for birthing neoliberalism to
Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Certainly he is correct in citing those
two men as key figures in the revival of "classical liberalism." But then he
writes "This new liberalism is what they began to call neoliberalism..." (73).
I have read a fair amount of both Mises and Hayek, and I could not recall seeing
either of them every using that term. But I have not read everything either of
them wrote, so I asked a number of scholars specializing in their work if
they knew of any instances of either of them using that term. None of them did.
And Gerstle offers no evidence that they actually did use it. And this is a
flaw that appears frequently throughout this work: Despite almost 100 pages
of endnotes, the author repeatedly introduces dubious or partisan claims, but
offers absolutely no evidence to back them.

He then goes on to say that "Hayek [and] von Mises... wanted to be seen as the
creators of a disciplined 'thought collective'" (73). And he does provide a
endnote here: but the endnote only shows that in 2009, someone called
what they were doing a "thought collective." That is hardly evidence that these
two committed individualists wanted to be seen as part of a collective!


Gerstle describes economist Murray Rothbard's "chief aim" as being "to shrink to
Liliputian size the American Leviathan that had made possible the New Deal
order" (103). But Rothbard was an anarchist: his chief aim was to *eliminate*
the State, including the American instance, not to "shrink" it.


Gerstle clearly despises Patrick Buchanan: for example he notes that Buchanan
worried that NAFTA meant "tough hearty [white] men" (151) would lose their
jobs. Now clearly Buchanan did not say or write the "white" part, or Gerstle
would not have had to insert it in brackets. But is he justified in doing so?
He cites three works by Buchanan. The first is his speech to the Republican
national convention in 1992. The only reference to race in that speech is when
Buchanan praises "the brave people of Koreatown," whom I am pretty sure are not
white. The other two are pointers
to entire books: *The Death of the West* and *State of Emergency*. In the
former I found the sentence: "And any man, woman, or child, from any country or
continent, can be a good American. We know that from our history" (128). That
hardly sounds like a person who thinks that only white people can be real
Americans.

Gerstle claims that "Buchanan despised Mexicans both for their willingness to
work for low wages and for their allegedly inferior racial character" (152).
But when I search the sources Gerstle cites, I find statements like "There are
still millions of these hard-working, family-oriented, patriotic Americans of
Mexican heritage" (*The Death of the West*, p. 127). Now perhaps somewhere in
all that Buchanan wrote in his long career there *is* evidence to back
Gerstle's charges, but one would think, in making such incendiary claims, that
it is the responsibility of the claimant to point us to precise passages that
back up such claims, which Gerstle certainly fails to do.



Gerstle, in discussing the second, George Bush, contrasts the "hateful
ethnonationalist populism [of] Donald Trump" with the kind words of Bush, such
as his calling "On Americans, to respect the legitimacy of Islam and the law-
abiding Muslims who practiced it" (208-209). Gerstle Provides no evidence as
to what the hateful things Trump did consist of. But here it might be
worthwhile to note that whatever mean things Trump said, Bush's policies
actually resulted in the death of a couple million Muslims. One might think
that would outweigh some kind words in Gerstle's eyes, but apparently not.


Gerstle asserts that one of Donald Trump's "three beliefs" is "that America
should privilege its people of European descent" (248). Once again, there is
not a scrap of evidence presented to back this damning assertion. I recall
Trump saying many inflammatory things on the campaign trail. But I also recall
him repeatedly boasting that he would be the greatest president ever for black
Americans. Maybe he didn't really mean that, and maybe he really did think the
only Americans of European dissent were "real" Americans. But the burden of
proof is on Gerstle here, and he completely evades it.


In discussing Trump's embrace of Obama "birtherism," Gerstle writes 


Gerstle writes that "The Trump mob had gone berserk... smashing the heads of
policemen with fire extinguishers" (289). Gerstle presents no evidence at all
for this claim. Doing the research that perhaps Gerstle ought to have done, I
discover two sources for it:

1. A video shows that someone in the mob
tossed a fire extinguisher at a crowd of police. It
bounced off of an officer's helmet, leaving him apparently unfazed.
2. It was at first widely reported that policeman Brian Sicknick, who died the
day after the riot, was killed by protesters who had beaten him with a fire
extinguisher. But these reports turned out to have no factual basis, and it was
determined that Sicknick died of natural causes.

Gerstle also describes the riot as a "coup attempt" (289), again without citing
any evidence that this terribly disorganized mob actually had a scheme in place
to overthrow the U.S. government. The riot was an ugly event in which many
crimes were committed, but that is no reason to exaggerate about what took
place.


This is a somewhat infuriating book to review, because on the one hand, I
believe that Gerstle's central thesis is correct, and that he has done an
excellent job of showing that it is: there was, indeed, a New Deal political
order; it collapsed under pressure from multiple source, and was replaced by a
Neoliberal political order; and that latter order is now collapsing itself.
Unfortunately, Gerstle has intermingled, amidst the evidence for this salutary
historical thesis, a large number of partisan political points, which he
generally fails to defend at all.
