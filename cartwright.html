                This volume is a collection of essays broadly inspired by the 
                philosophy of science of Nancy Cartwright, the thinker who
                perhaps more than any other modern practitioner has turned the
                discipline towards a realist notion of causation, and an
                empirical appreciation for how scientists actually achieve the
                results they do, and away from the scientism
                behind such ventures as the "unity of science" project, which
                contends that all sciences should be branches of physics.
            </p>

            <p>
                In her own contribution to this book,
                Cartwright defends the notion of causation in singular cases
                against those who contend that only a statistical study on a
                large sample can produce robust evidence of causation. She
                holds that we can detect single causes much as we detect causes
                in a large study, as exhibitions of law-like regularities.

                Ot&aacute;vio Bueno and Robin Neiman address the vexed
                issue of when, if ever, clinical trials should be halted
                "early" because of accumulating evidence that the treatment 
                being tested is either causing such harm that it should no 
                longer be continued for the treatment group, or producing
                such benefits that denying it to the control group is
                unethical. But their effort suffers from vagueness
                and tautology: they complain, for instance, that stopping the
                trial early only constitutes "partial evidence" for the
                hypothesis being tested, as though any "full" trial could
                ever provide "full evidence." They worry that in such
                circumstances "the emerging pattern in the data may turn out to be 
                misleading: additional data could overthrow that pattern" (41).
                But obviously this worry also applies to "full" trials!
                They present such vacuous truisms as "one will eventually
                get full evidence [for a hypothesis, or] otherwise one
                won't" as genuine insights.  They claim that after a
                partial trial, "additional information needs to be
                gathered before any epistemic decision is made" (41), not noticing
                that "additional information needs to be gathered" <i>is</i>
                an "epistemic decision." They
                contend that evidence does not and should not
                depend on the beliefs of the person evaluating the evidence.
                But evidence is always evidence <i>to</i> someone,
                and whether something counts as evidence
                will depend upon their beliefs.

                In the most frustrating paper in the book, 
                Michael Strevens defines 'fundamentalism' as
                the notion that "Everything is
                made up of a single kind of stuff and everything
                that happens is directed
                solely by fundamental laws of physics that,
                depending on the configuration of
                stuff at one moment, determine its
                configuration at the next" (69). He goes on
                to claim that fundamentalism implies that
                all sciences really should 
                operate by showing how, say, mate selection
                in bower birds, or the nature of
                parliamentary institutions in Medieval Europe,
                can be derived from the laws of
                physics alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Strevens backs his fundamentalist faith
                with the claim that "the empirical
                evidence for fundamentalism has accumulated
                swiftly" (69). But he presents no
                such evidence, and instead he admits, "Real
                science is not only largely disunified;
                it is largely content to be disunified"
                (71). He confesses that Nancy Cartwright
                has shown that not only are
                other sciences not being reduced to physics,
                but even within physics, a plethora of sub-studies are not being
                reduced to "fundamental" physics. But
                like a good Biblical fundamentalist arguing
                away the dating of dinosaur bones,
                Strevens argues that this massive evidence
                against fundamentalism is actually
                what we should expect if fundamentalism is true.

            Roman Frigg and James Nguyen tackle the issue of how scientific models
            "represent" the phenomenon they model. Their
            answer is that a scientific model points to a class of
            events by declaration ("this is a model of the economy") but that
            it is <i>successful</i> as a scientific model
            to the extent it <i>exemplifies</i>
            particular aspects of the thing modeled.
            Thus, a model of the economy built from
            pipes and water is a <i>good</i>
            model if, say, the flow of cash through the real economy is
            exemplified by the flow of water through the pipes.

                Space does not permit a more thorough examination of the many
                interesting papers in this volume (of particular note among
                the neglected is Julian Reiss's excellent paper on causality),
                but for anyone interested 
                in the impact of Cartwright's work on the philosophy and
                the practice of science, this is an essential work.
