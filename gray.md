Reviewing one of John Gray's recent books is an adventurous undertaking. Rather than straightforward histories, or
philosophical or political arguments, or personal reminiscences, Gray seems to have adopted the approach to his
non-fiction work that Milan Kundera took to his novels: they are meditations on a topic, approaching it through a
variety of vantage points: some anecdotes, some historical episodes briefly narrated, a few interesting (and sometimes
horrifying) statistics, a witty or trenchant aper√ßu here, a brief argument there. It worked for
Kundera's novels, and it also works for Gray's books. But it does not confront the humble reviewer with a simple
undertaking.

His newest book highlights the nature of the work right in the sub-title: "Thoughts after Liberalism." This is not an
argument that liberalism has failed (such as Patrick Deneen's *Why Liberalism Failed* -- Gray takes its failure largely
as a given), or a program for what should come after liberalism (like the recent work of Curtis Yarvin), or a
philosophical critique of liberalism (which Gray himself has offered in ealier works). Instead, it is as though the
reader has been invited to eavesdrop on Gray's inner dialogues as he mulls over a post-liberal world.

While it might be possible to review this work in the same style in which it was written, well, that would be like
putting hot sauce on a dish of chili peppers: a bit much. Instead, I will organize this review around several of the
themes that are important in the book, and offer a sample of what Gray has to say about each one.


## Hobbes

In a book the title of which contains the word "Leviathan," we naturally would expect Thomas Hobbes to play an important
role.  And indeed he does: Throughout his meditations, Gray brings up Hobbes again and again. In fact, if one were to be
so bold and foolish as to offer a "central message" of the book, it might be that the circumstances that prompted Hobbes
to write *Leviathan* have again become salient in our time, as the liberal world order that prevailed for some years
after the fall of the Soviet Union collapses around us.

Gray first addresses Hobbes by noting that: "Hobbes was a liberal -- the only one, perhaps, still worth reading." (4) In
defense of the first half of this claim, he presents the four characteristics of liberalism provided in his own book,
*Liberalism*, to wit, liberalism is:

1. individualist
2. egalitarian
3. universalist
4. meliorist

And he goes on to argue that the above key liberal ideas are present in Hobbes in that, for him:

1. "Society is made up of individuals..."
2. "[each] equal in being exposed to death at each other's hands..."
3. "Human nature is universal in its needs..."
4. "With the application of reason, government can be improved..." (5)

Thus Hobbes is "the" proto-liberal. 
However, as Gray explains, "Each of these [liberal] ideas is a half-truth":

1. Individuals *are* the basis of society, but "self-preservation is only one of their needs: bare life is not enough."
2. Human beings "regularly give up peace and security in order to defend a form of life..."
2. "The most basic human goods may be universal but they are often sacrificed..."
3. "Society and government can be improved, but what is gained can always be lost... There is no complete or final exit
   from the state of nature." (5)

Gray's claim that Hobbes was a liberal may disconcert some who have interpreted Hobbes as a totalitarian; but
here Gray makes a crucial, often over-looked, point about Hobbes:

"Hobbes's was a state whose powers were unchecked, but its goals were strictly limited. Beyond securing its subjects
against one another and external enemies, it had no remit." (2)

Or, as Michael Oakeshott (whom Gray refers to as one of Hobbes's "best interpreters")
put it, "Hobbes is not an absolutist precisely because he is an authoritarian..." In other words, Hobbes's state existed
to keep its citizens from going to war with each other, and had whatever power it needed to meet that task.
But its area of authority did not include stopping them from smoking, or encouraging them to save
prudently for retirement, or making them approving of homosexuality, or prompting them to read elevating
literature or better appreciate art.

While Gray appreciates Hobbes, he is discerning in his appreciation, for instance, pointing out:

* "The social contract of which Hobbes writes is a rationalist myth." (12)
* "Hobbes's pessism is only seeming. When he asserts that self-preservation is the path to peace, he writes not as a
realist but as a utopian visionary."
* "Hobbes believed humankind could escpae the spell of language by constructing clear definitions of words. Here he
was misled by rationalism." (15)

Beyond these points, Hobbes makes many more appearances, including epigraphs from *Leviathan* (or
occasionally another work) that head each chapter and sub-chapter.


## Liberalism

Gray has much more to say about liberalism than what is mentioned above. For example, he notes a
similarity between contemporary liberals and other recent ideologies:

"The psychology of the political believer is not confined interwar communists and fellow travelers. The same mixture of
self deception and adamant certainty can be observed in post-Cold War liberals. They, too, cannot admit the demise of
the faith that has given meaning to their lives." (102)

Gray understands that the whole liberal project is based upon a metaphysics that modern liberals either ignore or
completely reject:

"Liberalism was a creation of Western monotheism and liberal freedoms part of the civilization that monotheism
engendered. Twenty-first-century liberals reject this civilization, while continuing to assert the universal authority of a
hollowed-out version of its values. In this hyper-liberal vision all societies are destined to undergo the
deconstruction that is underway in the West." (109)

"Populism" is a current bogeyman of contemporary liberals. But, as Gray points out, "populism... has no clear meaning,
but it is used by liberals to refer to political blowback against the social disruption produced by their own policies."
(133)

In the end, Gray contends, "If liberalism has a future, it will be as therapy against fear of the dark." (108)

## History

The nature of history is another theme that runs throughout this book.
Given that Gray regards history as an essentially undirected process, it is unsurpising that
he is not kind to Francis Fukuyama's thesis that we have reached "The End of History". He notes that Fukuyama's
announcement of "game over" for history is remarkably similar to Sidney and Beatrice Webb's 1936 claim
that Stalin's USSR was the "end of history," and a "New Civilization" would be built on Stalin's totalitarian model.

Gray examines the Hegelian roots of Fukuyama's work, "in which history showed one idea following another in dialectical
succession." (17) But, he contends, "In reality, no such history ever transpired. History with a capital letter is like
Humanity, an iridescent operation." (18)

He argues that world history since Fukuyama's book was published argue against his thesis:

"All the evidence suggests that we are moving back into an epoch that is classically historical, and not forward into
the empty, hallucinatory post-historial era projected in Fukuyama's article... The grotesque notion that history was
coming to an end in a universal convergence on American-style democracy was feted as realism." (19)

However, Gray claims that "While history is not the unfolding of reason, there can be logic in particular situations." (22) But
he does not provide any argument for believing that a process that is irrational should present us with "particular
situations" that are amenable to logical analysis: How could such situations arise? How can we identify them?
The repeated rolling of dice is not "the unfolding of reason," but we would never suspect that certain sub-sequences
would exhibit "logic."

Gray also offers an interesting insight on the difference between the Russian tsarist regime and the Soviet Union:

"Whereas the Romanov empire was a traditional despotism, the Soviet state was a new Leviathan... aiming to fashion a
new humanity... In the fifty years from 1867 to 1917, there were
around 25,000 deaths from executions and progroms. In the first five years of the Soviet state's existence, there were
around 200,000 executions..." (25-26) And this ignores deaths in camps: so the Soviet Union was killing its citizens at
roughly 100 times the rate of the Czars.


## Evolution

As someone who appreciates Michael Oakeshott, one would think that Gray would be careful to distinguish the
presuppositions of a theory from any discoveries made using it. Nevertheless, he writes:

"Here Fukuyama departs from the most important discovery in modern science. As understood by Charles Darwin, evolution
has no destination." (20)

But this is not something Darwin "discovered": how could it be? We would need a perspective looking backward from the
end of time to "discover" whether evolution has a destination. What Darwin did was pre-suppose that evolution proceeds
via random mutations, and then tried to see if he could explain the origin of species using that presupposition. The
fact that his theory does not contain a telos for evolution is hardly surprising, since that was the assumption made
in order to formulate the theory.

Gray follows this up by claiming, "Natural selection of genes is a purposeless process that is going nowhere." (20)
His forwarding of this as a bald fact is particularly surprising, given two later statements he makes.
In the first, he admits that "The accidental origins of Christianity, of course, prove nothing. For a believer,
chance is the work of providence." (124) (This would be better stated as, "For the believer, what may appear
to us as chance is actually the workings of an infinite mind.") So the fact that John Gray sees no purpose to evolution
hardly shows that it has no purpose. And in another passage, Gray notes that " ???


## Woke-ism

Gray is not pleased with "what has come to be called the woke movement," declaring that its
"origins... are in the decay of liberalism." (110) He notes that 
"If Western capitalism creates an expanding underclass without any productive function, it also produces a lumpen
intelligentsia that is economically superfluous." (111)

In other words, in societies that are in serious need of more auto mechanics and carpenters and plumbers, we are instead
producing far more doctors of gender studies and queer theory and even of English literature than are actually demanded:
so what can these "superfluous" individuals do to make a living? Well, they fight for jobs based on who is "most woke,"
which is a "vehicle through with surplus elites struggle to secure a position of power in society." (110)
Or, as Gray also puts it, "In their economic aspects, woke movements are a revolt of the professional bourgeoisie." (111)

Gray quite correctly debunks the claim that the woke movement is accurately described as "cultural Marxism":
"Contrary to its right wing critics, woke thinking is not a variety of Marxism. No woke ideologue comes anywhere close to
Karl Marx in rigour, breadth and depth of thought." (111)
In fact, 
"Once questions of identity become central in politics, conflicts of economic interest can be disregarded. Idle
chatter of micro-aggression screens out class hierarchy and the abandonment of large sections of society to idleness
and destitution." (111) In other words, identity politics, far from being "Marxist," is actually a way to divert
attention *away* from class issues towards relative trivialities.


## Conclusion: The Meaning(lessness) of Life

This book is a fascinating exploration of Gray's thoughts on a post-liberal world. Given the style of the work, it is
often hard to say when Gray is presenting "something interesting to think about" and when he is presenting "here's what
I think." So often it is not clear whether to critique some notion as Gray's own or not.

Nevertheless, there is a clear thread running throughout the work, one asserting that human life is a random emergence from
the inherently meaningless movements of matter in a universe lacking any purpose. As such, Gray, in spite of his own
views, shows the importance of faith. He is an intelligent and perceptive observer and critic of "the world of the
flesh," and is honest enough that he cannot hide from its ultimate meaninglessness (without illumination by the world of
the spirit). The result, as Gray so ably demonstrates, is bleak, but the bleakness only arises from his rejection of the
world of the spirit.
