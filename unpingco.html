                The book is divided into four chapter, the first named
                "Getting Started with Scientific Python," and the next three,
                logically enough, named "Probability," "Statistics," and
                "Machine Learning."
            </p>

                This book needed better editing, to avoid sentences like,
                "The pip installer does not check for such conflicts checks
                only if the proposed package already has its dependencies
                installed and will install them if not or remove existing
                incompatible modules" (3) or "Visual Studio Community
                Edition...  usually has enough to compile many C-codes" (3).
                The author recommends dividing by "the fractional powers of
                1/2" (14) when he means "the powers of the fraction 1/2." 
                Later he says an increase in dimensionality would necessitate
                "1000 more data points" instead of "1000 times more data
                points" (218). Of course these are just careless errors --
                surely the author meant to write the latter version in both
                cases -- but such errors can seriously hamper a novice 
                trying to master a new subject.
