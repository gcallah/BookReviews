            <p>
            Bas van Bavel has produced an important historical study, one
            highly relevant to current debates on economic policy.
            </p>

            <p>
            Van Bavel's work might best be characterized as "applied history."
            (Students of Michael Oakeshott will recognize that this means van
            Bavel, while doing serious historical research, is primarily
            dealing with the "practical past," i.e., the past viewed as
            providing lessons for present choices.) The context in which this
            work is set is the ongoing debate over optimal economic policy. For
            a time, from the collapse of the Soviet Union until about a decade
            ago, it seemed that this debate might be settled: neoliberalism had
            triumphed, and the best political economy prescription clearly
            involved a heavy dose of free markets. Certainly, there was debate
            at the margins: Should healthcare be publicly provisioned? How big
            a welfare state should one have? What is the proper role for
            central banks and international economic institutions like the IMF?
            And there were always heretics like Marxists and Catholic social
            theorists who demurred from this consensus, but they were like flat
            earthers or creationists, and could be safely ignored.
            </p>

            <p>
            But then came the financial crisis of 2007-2008, and all that had
            seemed settled was at play again. The response to the crisis by
            free-market advocates most typically ran along these lines: "Yes,
            the crisis was bad, but it was the result of crony capitalism, not
            of true free markets. If the central banks and the international
            economic institutions had not gotten in bed with the big banks,
            this all could have been avoided." And there is, I think, a good
            deal of truth in this response.
            </p>

            <p>
            But van Bavel's work provides a very important counter-response.
            Van Bavel's main thesis is that open markets work well, for a time,
            at producing wealth and lifting all boats. But with the rise of
            factor markets, meaning market dominance over the allocation of
            land, labor, and capital, there arises an increasingly wealthy
            financial elite, and that wealth gives them an increasing influence
            over social conditions in general. In particular, this elite
            becomes more and more able to bend the legal system of their
            society to serve their own interests. In short, unfettered free
            markets produce crony capitalism as their probable (at times van
            Bavel seems to suggest inevitable) outcome, much as consuming
            crystal meth, while providing a boost for a time, sooner or later
            produces a collapse in health.
            </p>

            <p>
            Van Bavel backs his thesis with extensive evidence from three case
            studies: Iraq between 500 and 1100 CE, Northern Italy from 1000 to
            1500, and the Low Countries between 1100 and 1800. He also touches,
            much more lightly, upon other instances of market societies, such
            as England, the United States, early modern China, and the Roman
            Empire.
            </p>

            <p>
            "the rise and dominance of markets for land, labour, and capital
            are self-undermining, as... feedback mechanisms results in welfare
            declining again and markets losing their quality in facilitating
            successful and rapid exchange, with a relative or even absolute
            downfall of the market economy in question." (pg. 2)
            </p>

            <p>
            "When peasants in developing countries lose their direct access to
            land and the means of production, and become reliant on markets for
            food, land, and wage labour, they can actually become more
            dependent and even more vulnerable than they would have been in a
            peasant society with limited market influence..." -- Bas van Bavel,
            The Invisible Hand?, p. 6
            </p>

            <p>
            "The Iraqi elites started to immobilize their wealth in <i>waqf</i>s, or
            religious and charitable foundations, partly in order to shield it
            from taxation by the state. The <i>waqf</i>, as an unincorporated and
            inalienable trust, appeared on the stage around the mid-eighth
            century and grew in importance by the ninth century, especially in
            Iraq... A major motive for the foundation of a <i>waqf</i> was the wish to
            serve a religious, charitable, or public purpose... For the
            founder, some additional advantages of using this instrument was
            that he could appoint himself as an administrator of the <i>waqf</i>, he
            could set his own salary to be paid out of the <i>waqf</i>'s funds, he
            could nominate relatives to positions paid for by the <i>waqf</i>, And he
            could designate his children as his successors. This last advantage
            help to circumvent the Islamic inheritance lawsâ€¦ What the same time
            he could shield the family property from taxation by public
            authorities." Bas van Bavel, The Invisible Hand?, p. 76
            </p>

            <p>
            "Output per worker around 1300 was as high as after 1348, even
            despite the windfall gains caused by the population decline of the
            Black Death..." -- Bas van Bavel, The Invisible Hand, p. 107.
            </p>

            <p>
            The thinking here seems to be that with fewer workers working the
            same amount of land, employing the same amount of capital, output
            per worker "should" have gone up. But this seems to ignore some
            important factors, such as the fact that many people were ill,
            while those who were not ill were often tending to the ill, or
            burying the dead, or fleeing to a remote retreat in order to avoid
            becoming ill. Once we take these countervailing factors into
            account, it is not at all obvious to me that a plague will present
            a "windfall gain" in output per worker.

            <p>
            As a student of social cycles, I am always on the lookout for new instances of
            social cycle theories. And in writing my current book review, I have come
            across one: the free-market cycle. Here is the author of The Invisible Hand?,
            Bas van Bavel, describing this cycle:
            The three main cases analyzed in the book, and also the three modern cases that
            are more tentatively discussed, show a similar pattern in the interaction of
            society, market institutions, and economy. In this pattern, an originally
            positive feedback cycle -- between increasing freedom, growing factor markets,
            and economic growth -- turns into a negative one, with the increasing social
            polarization, institutional sclerosis, markets that become increasingly skewed
            towards the interests of market elites, and economic growth stagnating and
            turning into relative or absolute decline. (251)
            The cases being analyzed are ones in which factor markets -- for land, labor,
            and capital -- come to increasingly dominate the allocation of those resources.
            At first, the process yields good results: "these markets acquired favorable
            institution organization which offered security, transparency, and broad
            accessibility" (252). An important factor in these favorable results was that
            non-elite actors "had access to alternative mechanisms of exchange outside the
            market and therefore were free to choose whether to use factor markets or not"
            (253). (Such mechanisms included guilds, strong family institutions, networks
            of barter exchange, and production for home consumption from one's own land.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
            But as factor markets began to eliminate such alternatives, often through
            "outright attacks" (254) on them -- e.g., enclosure laws, or anti-guild
            legislation -- "wealth inequality rose to high, or even unprecedented levels"
            (255). To preserve their wealth, the new elites "tied it up in family
            foundations, religious foundation, or fiduciary entails" (258-259). Despite the
            fact that such events often prompted an artistic florescence, they indicated "a
            tipping point in the cycle had passed, together with other signals including a
            highly skewed distribution of property, the increasing volatility of financial
            markets, big public indebtedness, the increasing application of non-economic
            coercion, and the freezing of capital" (259).
            </p>
            
            <p>
            "For Iraq... in the early tenth century, after three centuries of intense
            market development, it had become one of the most unequal societies recorded in
            history" (261). Similar results hold for Italy around 1400, for the Low
            Countries in the 1500s and 1600s. And the less rigorous studies the author
            offers for the UK and the US more recently show the same dynamic at work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Van Bavel offers a number of reasons for this result, e.g., "the wealthy
            usually have more access to information or legal expertise. With the growing
            scale and complexity of markets, the advantage this offers them also grows"
            (263). This factor weighs heavily against the anarcho-capitalist antidote to
            crony capitalism: there is no reason to believe that a financial elite cannot
            dominate the anarcho-capitalist "market" for law even more thoroughly than they
            can dominate the "production" of law in purportedly democratic societies.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Van Bavel asserts there is a predictable feedback mechanism at work here: "in
            all the cases of market economies discussed [increasing wealth inequality]
            became translated into inequality and political influence and decision-making
            power, which in its turn was used to adapt the institutional organization of
            factor markets to the interests of the wealthy" (264).
            </p>
            
            <p>
            In short, "mature market economies as a result of this feedback cycle change
            from being open and equitable to become unequal and distorted" (265).
            </p>
            
            <p>
            This is what we actually see in every single case where "free markets" come to
            dominate a society. It is all well and good for libertarians to bemoan "crony
            capitalism": but if this is the predictable outcome of their polices, they
            bemoan in vain.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The moral principles that market advocates often posit as counter-balances to
            the rise of crony capitalism are also ruled out in van Bavel's analysis:
            Moreover, the elements that reduce or compensate for negative externalities of
            market exchange they mainly be supplied by nonmarket organizations and by norms
            and values generated outside the market. In the course of time these norms and
            values, and the associated organizations, are instead eroded, as this book
            shows, their roles are usurped or superseded by the market. (266)
            </p>

            <p>
            "I do not think the market fosters immorality of individuals... On the single
            point... I would agree with McCloskey... However, this is not because
            capitalism will improve our ethics, as McCloskey argues, but rather because
            such a critique misses the crucial mechanism and the essential point. Even if
            the market itself does not anti-more, and market behavior at the micro level is
            not immoral either, the outcome of market dominance at the macro level in the
            longer will likely be a negative one, as shown in the cases investigated...
            This negative outcome is bound to occur particularly within a skewed social
            context..." -- Bas van Bavel, The Invisible Hand, p. 267
            </p>


            <p>
            "Also, in the course of the cycle described here, those groups and
            organizations in society who would aim for changing the arrangements of the
            market in order to balance or reduce negative externalities, gradually lost
            their economic and political power... Their revolts in the later stages of the
            cycle proved futile. This is also because of the consolidation and entrenchment
            of the elite in these later stages... Exactly in the last phases of the cycle
            the elites... closed their ranks...
            </p>
            
            <p>
            "In all these cases, the state increasingly came under the influence of those
            who benefited most from the market system...
            </p>
            
            <p>
            "In the first phase of the cycle, in each of these cases, the role of the state
            was not yet very prominent,  and it figured next to all kinds of other
            organizations and associations that fulfilled semi-public roles... In the
            second phase, states... increasingly stimulated the rise of markets in more
            direct ways, induced to do so because of fiscal reason. These markets, with the
            associated monetization and commodification of land and labour, enabled them to
            tap resources and tax transactions and wealth more easily than with other forms
            of exchange and allocation, such as barter or communal redistribution.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            "Each of the cases discussed saw growing state repression, armed violence, and
            warfare by state and public authorities, in the last stage of the cycle. It is
            telling that this was done after the militias of ordinary people were replaced
            by professional soldiers or slaves, hired or bought in the market and being
            more dependent on their employers or masters than the independent producers in
            the former militias were."
