The book under review here is a thorough and enlightening look at how Berkeley's life
and philosophy intertwined. The fact this this review essay focuses on some
points where I disagree with the author should not be read to indict the
quality of the work as a whole.

Jones opens his book with a very strong claim:

"Berkeley's documented life and participation in various institutions and
practices, such as those of the exclusive educational institutions of a
Protestant elite, is inseparable from his treatment of major philosophical and
social issues" (3).

Jones does not contend that on
occasion, we might get insight into a thinker's philosophical position by
examining that thinker's biography. No, he claims that Berkeley's (and I assume not
just Berkeley's: more on this below) philosophical
ideas are "inseparable" from his biography. Should we accept or reject
immaterialism based on what we think of how Berkeley led his life? Many people
have read Berkeleys argument for immaterialism and discussed it without knowing
anything about his biography. Were they all mistaken to do so?

Henceforth in this review, I am assuming Jones would make a similar contention
vis-à-vis any philosopher’s work. And my justified in this assumption? A
subsequent quote might be used to argue that I am not: "I want to suggest that
the consideration of the central topics in B’s immaterialism offers a
justification of a biographical approach to his philosophical career... So
perhaps there is some thing about B’s philosophy that especially demands a
biographical approach to understand it? But the passage continues: “but one
that might first require us to rethink our ideas of what people are and how
they know one another” (4). Therefore, this biographical approach, given it is
based upon a certain understanding of “what people are”, ought to apply to
philosophers in general. And as we read on in Joneses work, what we will
discover is not that he suggests that B’s philosophy particularly *demands* a
biographical approach, but that his philosophy *supports* one. Let’s take a
look at this passage:


"But it is perhaps surprising that Berkeley’s immaterialism, his insistence
that there is only one substance — spirit — and that ideas are merely passive
effects of spirits to exist in willing some conceived and quite possibly
indistinct good, lends its support to a biographical approach to his
philosophy." (12-13)

Jones’s contention above is imprecise: if B’s arguments for immaterialism are
wrong, they do not lend support to *anything*: they are simply mistakes. If we
except a false proposition as a  premise in an argument, then “from falsehood
anything follows.” But if B’s arguments *are* correct, then they lend support
to analyzing the work of *any* philosopher biographically. And thus I will
treat them, which raises the question: 
How about
this very book under review: if I hope to understand this book, do I need to
read a biography of Jones? If Jones's contention is true, it would seem that
every intellectual work ought to be accompanied by a biography of the person
who wrote it. 

An unfortunate recurrence throughout the book is a certain temporal
parochialism, an apparent conviction that the current ideas are the best ideas
(so far, at least), and that when they disagreed with past ideas, clearly the
past ideas are to blame. This shows up early on when Jones writes, "Perhaps not
everyone feels that Berkeley’s God is an embarrassment..." (15). Countless
thinkers in the past would have found today's presumption of materialism an
embarrassment. And many of them were very bright people.

Another example of this temporal bias is Jones's puzzle here:
"Here, as in so many other locations in seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century social thought,
the possibility that rank produces, or is otherwise complicit in, the
adumbration of natural rights to justice and equity is mysteriously invisible"
(192).

Jones should remember the parochialism is not limited to earlier ages: It is
quite possible that a social thinker from the 1700s would note how mysterious it
is that 21st-century social thinkers believe that rank is in conflict with
natural rights to justice and equity.

Jones's understanding of the physics and mathematics he discusses is not always
adequate to the task. For instance, at one point he calls fluxions "the forces
that cause changes in motion" (55): but this is nonsense. "Fluxion" was
Newton's term for an instantaneous rate of change, and had nothing to do with
what force might be causing that change.

Jones mentions that by the time he left Dublin, many of Berkeley's "enduring and
idiosyncratic  tendencies" (141) had already become apparent. Among these is
contention that the world "is a world of ideas" (141): This illustrates a
degree of continuity amongst the British idealists that is often denied, for
we find Michael Oakeshott making the exact same contention in 1933.

Jones then goes on to say, "For all that the world may appear to have
physical being, tangible or visible extension, its real existence is as ideas"
(141). This is a mistake made by many interpreters of Berkeley: he is **not**
claiming that there is no physical world, or tangible or visible extension. He
is claiming that the world's physicality is **itself** an idea, as is
extension. These things are not illusions that must be dispelled by Berkeley's
philosophy: they are realities whose basis it attempts to explain.

In discussing Berkeley's travels in England, Italy, and America, Jones
highlights how prominent thoughts on social improvement were in Berkeley's life. Even
his most famous "metaphysical" works partook of this tendency, as they were
foremost intended as a means of defeating skepticism and atheism, which Berkeley saw
as serious threats to social order.

Berkeley's wife is quoted as saying, "He has taken from them the ground they stand on,
& had he built as he has pulled down he had been down a master builder indeed
but Unto every Man his Work some must remove rubbish, & others lay
Foundations..." Jones's questionable reading of this quote is that "Berkeley's
wife taught him more destructive than productive as a philosopher" (304). But
Mrs. Berkeley said that what he was pulling down was "rubbish," and surely
removing rubbish is a constructive, not a destructive, activity.

Berkeley's project of founding a university in Bermuda is a strange episode in his
career, although Jones makes a good case that it should be understood as a
facet of his larger project of Anglican education.

While discussing this topic, Jones makes a curious claim: "But his Bermuda
project was obliquely complicit in the modern, import-oriented economy he
despised and the full range of human cruelty is it required -- bondage, and
forced movement of populations, and eradication of indigenous peoples and their
ways of life and habitats" (348). Even though Berkeley plan to raise funds for
his project through selling small land holdings on St. Christopher (St.
Kitts), nevertheless this would "obliquely but ultimately require the dystopia
of plantation colonialism and slavery" (348).

First of all, it is not at all clear what Jones means by "require" here: We
found universities today, even on remote islands, without "requiring"
plantation colonialism and slavery. It is true that what wound up happening on
St. Christopher was that the land was dominated by large, slave-worked
plantations. But this happened without Berkeley being involved in the land
sales, and without his college ever being built. One can never prove historical
counterfactuals, but perhaps if his scheme has gone
through, the outcome on St. Christopher would have been different.

But even odder Is this notion of "oblique" responsibility: Once we adopt such a
flimsy standard for placing blame, it seems we have to condemn everyone alive
at the moment some unsavory event was occurring: Weren't even the Native
Americans and the slaves "obliquely" responsible for the what happened?

In discussing Berkeley's work *Alciphron*, Jones seems overly anxious to assure
the reader that Berkeley's "right thinkers" are just as subject to prejudice as
are his "free thinkers." For instance, Jones quotes Berkeley as writing,

"[W]ho would choose for his Guide in the Search of Truth, a Man...
whose Education hath been behind a Counter, or in an Office?
Or whose Speculations have been employed on the Forms of Business,
who are only well read in the ways and commerce of Mankind, in
Stock-jobbing, Purloining, Supplanting, Bribing?"

Jones comments:

"In the choice of what kind of human character we wish to be
led by... what sort of person we take to have clear and extensive views, Crito
is set against anyone working in business and finance. This prejudice seems as
unfounded as the freethinking prejudiced for nobility of rank..." (373)

However, Jones has left out important part of the quote from *Alciphron*; Crito
also recommends against taking as a guide "a Man whose Thoughts and Time are
taken up with Dress, Visits, and Diversions" (*Alciphron*, Second Dialogue,
section XIX). Once we combine that with his "*only* well read", it is clear
that Crito is claiming that a mind *consumed* by thoughts of fashion and
socializing, or by thoughts of financial gain, will not make a good
philosopher. That hardly seems to be a prejudice.

In a chapter called "The True End of Speech," Jones turns his attention to Berkeley
as a philosopher of language and semiotician. This is an aspect of Berkeley's
thought that has garnered a great deal of attention lately. (See, for instance
Kenneth Pearce's *Language and the Structure of Berkeley's World*.) Jones opens
the chapter with a quote from Berkeley that shows that the bishop himself
would have welcomed this emphasis:

"The Doctrine of Signs is a Point of great Importance, and general Extent, which,
if duly considered, would cast no small Light upon Things..." (*Alciphron*
VII.6, quoted on 379).

Jones notes that:

"The arguments Berkeley deploys in this account of language have a 20th-century
field: his introduction of rules of conduct and changes of behavior as tests of
whether a term is meaningful are revolutionary. He has been thought a precursor
of Wittgenstein, Grice, and Austin." (384)

In both the chapter "Passive Obedience, and in "Discipline," Jones
highlights an important conundrum that neither he nor I believe Berkleley
successfully resolved: As an advocate of passive obedience to the current
secular rulers, would not Berkeley have to condemn the fact that they themselves
gained power by overthrowing the Stuart dynasty? And in recommending that
Christians accept the doctrines of the current (Anglican) established church
and not engage in "free thinking," how could he avoid the conclusion that the
founders of the Anglican church were wrong in not accepting the doctrines of
the Catholic Church and asserting their own right to "free thinking" at its
expense? In fact, his embrace of passive obedience cost him preferment on some
occasions, as critics rightly saw that it could be used to challenge the
legitimacy of the house of Hanover. And, as Jones notes, his position on church
authority was condemned by contemporaries as a "threat to the liberty from
overbearing ecclesiastical authority that the Protestant movement itself
represented" (421).

This book is an excellent addition to the literature on B, one that gives the reader
a rich feel not just for Berkeley's own life, but for the context in which that life
and those works were contained. It is true that understanding Berkeley's life better
does cast new light on his works. But as far as 
the claim Jones makes, that Berkeley's life and his philosophy are "inseparable," 
this juror must bring in a verdict of "Unproven." For instance, Berkeley certainly
was inspired to debunk the newly fashionable theory of matter put forth by
figures such as Descartes and Locke based on the fact that he felt it promoted
skepticism. But Berkeley's arguments as to why matter, as his targets understood it, was
an untenable concept, do not depend upon his motivation in making them. They
either succeed or not on their own merits. It is very interesting to learn
about Berkeley's intimate involvement with elite Protestant education, his desire to
defend and promote Anglicanism, and his efforts to gain better positions within
the church. But numerous people at the time were educated in elite Protestant
institutions, promoted Anglicanism, and sought better jobs. But only one of
them wrote books arguing for immaterialism.

As noted at the beginning of this review, if we cannot consider a thinker's
arguments apart from that thinker's life history, then Jones's book itself is
radically incomplete: every copy ought to be shipped with a biography of Jones.
And unless that is an autobiography, that biography should come with a
biography of the person who wrote *it*. And so on, ad infinitum.
