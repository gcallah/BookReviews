                     Against the Grain:
                     A Deep History of the Earliest States
                </i>
                James C. Scott,
                Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2017
            </h3>

            <p>
                James C. Scott gave two lectures in 2011 on
                plant and animal domestication and the earliest states. But the
                discussion afterwards convinced him that his
                arguments "were not remotely ready for prime time" (x). So he
                plunged into five years of research on these topics, and the
                result is this work under review.
                Scott's central aim is to examine to what extent "settling
                down" to fixed-field farming, and the subsequent rise of states
                actually represented, as the conventional narrative holds,
                an advance in the well-being of the people who 
                underwent those transformations. 
            </p>

            <p>
                One reason Scott doubts the conventional story
                is the great instability of early states.
                Besides "extrinsic" causes, such as
                climatic events, Scott cites three "intrinsic" causes of the
                demise of early states: the high incidence of disease caused by
                the unprecedented crowding of human beings and their livestock,
                the huge new demand for lumber that stripped watersheds of a
                barrier to flooding, and intensive irrigation that led to
                salinization of the soil.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scott also dismisses the belief that we can categorize people
                into a scale of "advancement" based on whether they were
                hunter-gatherers, shifting cultivators, pastoralists or
                settled farmers. Instead, people readily shifted between these
                modes of living based on environmental conditions.
            </p>

            <p>
                In fact, Scott insists, there is no single point at which
                hunter-gatherers suddenly become farmers. "Pre-agricultural"
                people used "hundreds of techniques" (p. 70) to modify their 
                environment to get more of the plants they used. Given the
                richness of pre-agricultural food sources, the question of why
                fixed-field grain farming was adopted in the first place
                remains unanswered. The mystery deepens when we
                contemplate that, in the process of domesticating
                cereals and livestock, we were forced, to a great extent, to
                domesticate ourselves as well, devoting an extraordinary degree
                of attention to these increasingly fragile food sources.

            <p>
                Early states, Scott holds, were based upon collecting people in
                a limited area who could produce a surplus of some cereal,
                and then collecting that surplus to support the state.
                He outlines why cereals are crucial here: cereals grow
                above ground, and so are easily surveyed, and they ripen all at
                once, so the tax collector knows when to come around for
                collection. Some degree of coercion was necessary to extract
                the surplus for the state, but early states
                faced a delicate balancing act: since there were always
                non-state regions close by, if their extractions became too
                onerous, the state's subjects might flee.
                States often responded to this threat by erecting
                barriers to flight, such as the Great Wall of China.
                Another measure that early states 
                employed to fight the loss of subjects was the capturing of
                slaves in war.

            <p>
            Scott closes with a chapter entitled "The
            Golden Age of the Barbarians." He notes how 
            for millennia after the rise of the first states, the vast
            majority of the globe's population lived outside of states. But
            among those non-state peoples, a few took on special status as
            "barbarians": they were at the periphery of a
            state, and their lives and their economies were
            deeply intertwined with those of their state-dwelling counterparts.
            At times, they interacted with their neighbor states simply by
            raiding. But a more stable strategy was to agree, in return
            for abjuring raiding, that they receive some form of subsidy.
            These barbarians realized that running a protection racket is a better
            long-run strategy than wiping out the source of revenue, a
            strategy Scott notes "is hard to distinguish from the
            archaic state itself" (p. 141).
            While the lives of barbarians may have been both healthier and freer than
            their neighbors living within states, Scott notes two
            "melancholy" aspects of this golden age: by capturing slaves
            for states, and providing them with military service,
            "the barbarians willingly dug their own grave" (p. 256).
            </p>

            <p>
                Many of Scott's contentions in this work are speculative, and
                new research may overturn some of the bases for them.
                Nevertheless, this is a landmark work, with which future
                studies on the rise of the state will have to contend.
