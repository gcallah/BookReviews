                A Political Philosophy of Conservatism: Prudence,
                Moderation and Tradition

                Ferenc Hörcher. 2020. Bloomsbury Publishing: London.
                210 pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hungarian political philosopher, and historian of political
                thought, Ferenc Hörcher, has launched a case for conservatism
                in politics based on the virtue of prudence. His book consists
                of two main parts, the first a historical survey of the most
                important thinkers who dealt with prudence from Aristotle
                through the twentieth century. The second part of the book is
                more philosophical, and addresses why prudence is a vital
                concern, given the finite nature of human life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hörcher begins by examining
                ancient and Christian traditions of prudence. First up
                is Aristotle's concept of <i>phronesis</i>, which might be
                translated as "practical wisdom." <i>Phronesis</i> is distinct
                from theoretical knowledge, in that the latter is independent
                of particular circumstances, while the former consists
                precisely in how to deal with particularities. In this respect,
                Hörcher sees Aristotle as advancing from the work of his
                teacher, Plato, who did not distinguish between theoretical
                smarts and practical know-how.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hörcher makes a very important point in his discussion of
                Aristotle: for the philosopher, what is required for a healthy
                polity "is not convincing people by argument, but rather
                through training and experience" (17). If Aristotle is correct,
                it would certainly explain the interminability of modern
                political and ethical arguments: for a people not trained in
                a practice of virtue, arguments in its favor will likely carry
                little weight. Contemporary philosopher Claes Ryn has
                emphasized this point in his work on the importance of the will
                and the imagination.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cicero is understood by Hörcher as offering a conservative
                defense of the importance of attention to tradition in the face
                of the radical changes which the Roman Republic was undergoing
                during his life. However, for Cicero, tradition was not a
                static idol to be worshipped: "tradition... needs to be updated
                to meet the demands of the day" (23). Thus, Cicero can be seen
                as offering an early answer to contemporary critics of
                conservatism, who contend that it is inflexible in responding
                to new circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
                Augustine is treated only briefly. Hörcher's main contention is
                that, due to Augustine's view of the will, activities in "the
                city of man" are inevitably self-centered. This keeps
                Augustine's politics grounded in realism, even as he stresses
                the importance of Christian virtue in social life. Somewhat
                curiously, almost half of the section on Augustine is actually
                devoted to Aquinas, who also gets his own section, without
                another thinker butting in.
            </p>

            <p>
                Aquinas
            </p>


            <p>
                Hörcher's discussion of Machiavelli, Guicciardini and Botero
                focuses on a critical turning point in political thought,
                something noted by Pocock is in magisterial work <i>The
                Machiavellian Moment</i>. Machiavelli seems to divorce
                practically oriented political action altogether from the
                sphere of classical/Christian morality. As Hörcher sees things,
                Guicciardini offers "the proper answer to Machiavelli's
                challenge from within the Christian Aristotelian framework"
                (42).

            </p>

            <p>
                Concluding his historical survey, Hörcher turns to "late modern
                <i>prudentia</i>." Here he sees Gadamer, Geuss, Ricoeur,
                and Bernard Williams as leading examples of thinkers who
                contemplated practical action in recent times.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hörcher next analyzes the key difficulties which face the
                exercise of prudence in politics, which he calls
                "agency-constraint," "time-constraint," and
                "knowledge-constraint."
            </p>

            <p>
                The challenge in the first case, agency constraint, is to
                overcome our ego-centered view and realize that the common good
                is also our own good.
            </p>

            <p>
                "That is made possible by the fact that the Catholic philosophy
                of personhood preserves and reconciles the valuable elements of
                both the individualist and the communal perspective...
                There is a mutual interdependence between personhood and
                sociability" (90).

            </p>

            <p>
                Grappling with the second constraint, time,
                means overcoming our present-centered view and extending our
                perspective, as far as possible, into the past and future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hörcher quotes the German Thomist (?) Joseph Pieper:
                “Realization of the good presupposes that our actions are
                appropriate to the real situation that is to the concrete
                realities which formed the ‘environment’ of a concrete human
                action”￼(96).
            </p>

            <p>
                Hörcher agrees with Aquinas that “emphasis on the variety of human
                means does not concern the end of the action, which is fixed,
                but only suggest that to achieve it, different circumstances
                demand different strategies” (99). It is like reaching the peak
                of a mountain: all may have the goal of arriving there, but
                each will have to use different means depending upon how they
                are equipped, where they are on the mountain, and their innate
                abilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                And the third constraint of the trio, knowledge, is notable
                because we never possess the complete knowledge of our
                circumstances that would be needed to act with certainty of
                success. In this section the main figures are Michael Polanyi,
                Michael Oakeshott, and F.A. Hayek. Their theories, showing how
                knowledge can be embedded in customs and practices, indicate
                the importance of traditions for coping with the knowledge
                constraint: traditional practices are usually not,
                contrary to modern prejudice, superstitious atavisms best 
                replaced by "scientific" methods: instead, they are the
                accumulated wisdom of a culture.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a small problem in Hörcher's discussion of Oakeshott.
                Hörcher writes, "To be sure, [for Oakeshott] every practical
                human activity... requires first of all technical knowledge"
                (114). This may be merely loose writing, but at the least it is
                misleading. It is not the case that, in Oakeshott's view, an
                activity "first of all" requires a technique. Humans did not
                invent a technique for walking, or hunting, or tool-making,
                which they then used as a guide to begin that activity. Rather,
                our technical knowledge is parasitic on an existing practice,
                from which, over time, we glean various rules for how to
                proceed.

                The prudent individual's resources: virtues and character

                Citing Hankins study of Renaissance republics, Hörcher
                quotes a passage particularly relevant given the current
                debates over the fate of liberalism:
                <br/>
                "A successful republic cannot be simply a system of procedures
                for adjusting interests, employing institutional means devoid
                of any moral orientation" (Hankins, quoted on 127).

            </p>

            <p>
                For Hörcher the difference between Ciceronian prudence and
                Machiavellian prudence is of great importance: Cicero's
                prudence was always set in the context of the religious and
                moral traditions of the Roman people, while for Machiavelli,
                prudence had degraded into mere "cunning," that allowed one to
                achieve whatever political outcome one desired.
            </p>

            <p>
                Summary 
            </p>

            <p>
                In summing up, Hörcher claims that although two approaches to dealing
                with the problem of agency constraint, Kantian "asocial sociaility"
                and Catholic social teaching, are built on different
                foundations, "the result is the same" (163). I wonder if this
                is really so; Hörcher's own discussion of the two earlier in
                this work makes me doubt it is so.
            </p>

            <p>
                The book ends on a puzzling note: the last sentence is:
                "Abstracting a political philosophy from actual historical
                cases will always remain somewhat lifeless and thus risky;
                therefore, the conservative politics of prudence has to confine
                itself and its findings to what has been written so far and,
                for the moment, give up digging any deeper or further" (166).
                I must admit I do not grasp the connection between the first
                part of that sentence and the "therefore," nor what it has to
                do with the rest of the book.
            </p>

            <p>
                A minor quibble I have is with the editors: while Hörcher is not
                a native English speaker, the editors at Bloomsbury presumably
                are, and they could have done a better job rendering the
                English more idiomatic. For example, one of the cjapter titles,
                "How to Find the Proper Action in Politics," surely would have
                been more idomatic as, "How to Act Properly in Politics."
            </p>

            <p>
                But that is a small flaw in an otherwise excellent work.
                This book is a valuable addition to the political theory
                literature, as it makes clear that prudence is indeed a
                <i>virtue</i> in political practice, and not an unprincipled
                compromise with a fallen world. In our time of ideological
                extremes, such a demonstration takes on extra importance.
