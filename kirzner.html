                Israel M. Kirzner is the dean of the "Austrian school" of
                economics. (I use scare quotes only because some, even some
                called "Austrian," dispute there is such a school, often
                contending that it has been absorbed into the mainstream.) Over
                six decades he has produced a stream of papers and books
                defending and extending the insights into the market process
                achieved by his mentors Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek.

				"The model cannot be used to 'explain' market prices; the model
                presumes that everyone has, somehow, correctly and
                self-fulfilling guessed what the market price is going to be.
                The circumstance that (quite apart from the assumed correctness
                of the anticipated price) the model treats each market
                participant as a price-taker further underscores the
                uselessness of the model as an explanation for the manner in
                which prices are adjusted. No one in the model ever does change
                his price bids or offers." -- p. 52
