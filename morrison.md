# Keynes, Churchill, and the Governance of Economic Beliefs

"Just as the earliest people conjure the supernatural as the superintendents of
the seasons, so to have modern people created economic religions to describe
some meaning, purpose, and direction to the forces that govern our lives." (7)

This is historically inaccurate, as deities like the Greek pantheon were not
super natural, but were what Eric Voegelin calls “intra-cosmic gods,“ very much
a part of the natural order. And it relies upon the long discredited view of
religion as merely an early and very bad attempt at doing science.

Morrison makes a great deal of the fact that "the" gold standard meant very
different things in different times and places. No doubt he is right about
that: but given it is so, how can one use this specific incident involving this
particular version of the gold standard to dismiss all of the multifarious
version?
