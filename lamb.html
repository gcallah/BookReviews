            Lamb, for instance, notes Sarkar’s claim that “many people in
            capitalist developing countries could only dream of the economic
            living standards of the German democratic republic” (5). True,
            acrylic my reply, but the east German workers we’re enjoying a
            standard of living that had declined from Germany’s capitalist
            past, while those in developing countries were experiencing rising
            standards of living as their nations had become more capitalist.
            The critics claim may or may not be true: the point I wish to make
            here is that Lamb typically does not even consider such opposing
            points of view to his.
