---

Margaret Atherton has written a wonderful introduction to the 
work of George Berkeley, in which she systematically walks the reader through
the various stages in his argument for immaterialism. By carefully examining
what Berkeley meant in some of his most disputed passages, reading them in the
context of his other writings as well as of the philosophical milieu in which
he moved, Atherton succeeds in dispelling much of the shroud of absurdity
in which his ideas have too often been cloaked.

## Life and work



## NTV

Atherton begins addressing Berkeley's writings by examining *An Essay Towards a
New Theory of Vision*, a lesser known work of his, and asks whether this work,
which appeared before his two major philosophical works, was some sort of
diversion, or a coherent preliminary to them.


## Principles: Intro


## Principles summary


## Principles objections

Atherton then proceeds to examine the "Objections" section of the *Principles*.

One important objection to *The Principles* was "whether Berkeley is entitled to endorse
the Copernican theory, to which he has made reference in recent replies, if no
one has actually perceived the motion of the earth" -- p. 77

"Berkeley's reference to "what we should perceive" is not an account of possible
motions waiting to exist if we should relocate to the heavens, but merely a
reminder that the process by which we ultimately describe motion to an
unobservable earth still retains the idea of motion as observed, because it is
a consequence of the laws of motion, themselves generalized from observed
motion." -- Pg. 78

But I think Berkeley could have made an even strong point here: we *do*
see the motion of the earth, and in exactly the same way that we see the motion
of a ship that we are sailing on: we see that motion by seeing other things
moving relative to our "vehicle" (the ship or the earth). Here it may be
apropos to bring up a story of Elizabeth Anscombe's:

"He (Ludwig Wittgenstein) once asked me: 'Why do people say it is more logical
to think that the sun turns around the Earth than Earth rotating around its own
axis?' I answered: 'I think because it seems as if the sun turns around the
Earth.' 'Good,' he said, 'but how would it have been if it had seemed as if the
Earth rotates around its own axis then?'"
-- Anscombe, 1959, p. 151

## Conclusion

At the end of the book, I was left with a few questions that I wished it had taken up:

Atherton makes it very clear that Berkeley is largely addressing contemporary
or near-contemporary philosophers such as Descartes, Locke, and Malebranche. I
wondered if he would have the same objections to hylomorphic theories of matter
as he did to those of the Cartesians. (An especially relevant question given
the recent popularity of neo-Aristotelianism.)

I also wondered what Berkeley made of animals: given that they appear to have
sensations much like ours, would he have granted them the status of spirits? If
so, how would that move fit in with his mostly orthodox Christianity?


Lastly, it was less than clear to me how Berkeley differentiated ideas from
relations, which, on their surface, might appear to be a special type of idea.

But no book can be everything to everybody, and in the space she had, Atherton
has done a remarkable job introducing readers to the work of this very
important philosopher.
