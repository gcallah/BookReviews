Neither Jesus nor Buddha "put together a coherent argument." And often neither did Plato! (Gadamer)

I thought maybe I'd just meditate on your book and throw out my thoughts: but probably not a publishable review!


So how do you discover these fascinating but somewhat obscure episodes you offer in your recent works? (Examples)


Was the lack of teleology in evolution a discovery of modern science?

Newtonian physics did not *discover* that an object in motion tends to stay in motion: it presupposed this.

As an Oakeshottian, I understand every "special science" makes presuppositions: so no objection to Darwin's!

"Evolution is natural selection among random mutations."

Are the different regimes that emerge in history really "random mutations"?


You claim that "While history is not the unfolding of reason, there can be logic in particular situations." (22) But he does not provide any argument for believing that a process that is non-rational should present us with "particular situations" that are amenable to logical analysis: how could such situations arise? How can we identify them?

The repeated rolling of dice is not "the unfolding of reason," but we would never suspect that certain sub-sequences would exhibit "logic."

Why wouldn't the (more?) consistent critic of Hegel say you just haven't gone far enough?
