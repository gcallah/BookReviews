                Hörcher makes an interesting point in his discussion of
                Aristotle: for the philosopher, what is required for a healthy
                polity "is not convincing people by argument, but rather
                through training and experience" (17). If Aristotle is correct,
                it would certainly explain the interminability of modern
                political and ethical arguments.
