            <p>
            Not long before reviewing his
            book, I taught a class in C++ using Bjarne Stroustrup's 
            book <i>Programming: Principles and Practices Using C++</i>.
            Stroustrup, in four chapters (out of 26), has the reader
            build a small calculator including several advanced features.
            I thought <i>Practical C++ Design</i> would
            be a great follow-up, as its focus is on building a calculator
            in C++: I would surely pick up ways to extend the
            calculator I had built from Singer. But to my surprise, Singer
            takes a whole book to design a calculator in several ways less
            fully realized than Stroustrup's: there are no variables, for
            instance, and no grammar-driven parser.
            </p>

            <p>
            To be fair to Singer, he does include features Stroustrup
            does not, such as a complete separation of his calculator engine
            from the user interface, which enables him to create a two-faced
            calculator that can appear on the command line or in a GUI.
            And he shows how to implement a plug-in feature to extend the
            calculator, also absent in Stroustrup's program.
            Furthermore, Singer does an excellent job explaining what design
            patterns he employs to create each of his calculator's features.
            </p>

            <p>
            The book begins by setting out the "requirements"
            for the calculator to be built.  Even on a small project like this one,
            explicitly stating what is required may be useful.
            And here, this serves an additional didactic
            purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
            However, one of the "requirements" of the project is that the
            calculator use Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). Singer assures us
            that if we just get used to RPN, we'll like it. But several hundred
            years of mathematical practice suggest that human beings most
            easily understand mathematical expressions when they are written in
            the "normal" way, i.e., using infix notation. RPN was created to
            ease the burden on programmers and machines, not on users. 
            </p>

            <p>
            After laying out the user requirements, Singer explains his design
            requirements. The difference between the two is that the user
            requirements delineate what the software ought to <i>do</i>,
            while the design requirements describe how it ought to be
            constructed, in order to do what it needs to do. The chief design 
            virtues Singer wants to illustrate are modularity, encapsulation,
            cohesion, and low coupling. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Singer next explains the idea of patterns, and differentiates
            (software) architectural patterns and design patterns. 
            Per his distinction, design patterns apply primarily to a class or
            a small group of classes, while architectural patterns address
            entire information processing systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first of the two architectural patterns 
                that Singer examines is
                multi-tiering, separating a top-tier user interface
                from a middle, logic tier, and a bottom-level data tier.
                The second is model-view-controller (MVC).
                Singer describes the major difference between them:
                the multi-tier pattern restricts communication in the system to
                adjacent tiers, while the MVC pattern allows each of M, V, and
                C to communicate with the others as needed. (Singer winds up
                choosing MVC for his application.)
            </p>

            <p>
                In the rest of his progress towards a working calculator,
                Singer addresses many more important design ideas, including
                the "pimpl idiom" (a private pointer that keeps a class's
                private implementation out of a header file), the Observer
                pattern (for waiting on events), and the Command pattern (for
                implementing commands like "add" and "subtract").
                He discusses modern C++ features such as unique and shared
                pointers, the `final` keyword, and uniform initialization,
                and shows how they are superior to older styles used
                in similar situations. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to Singer's attention to modular design and his wise use 
                of design patterns, the `main()` function of the calculator
                can set up, assemble, and execute the calculator in just six
                lines. As he notes, the most important aspect of such a design
                is that a new programmer coming along to maintain the program
                can easily grasp its overall structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                This excellent book clearly demonstrates how to employ
                many OOP design patterns to create a maintainable, working 
                program. I only wish Singer had taken note of his illustrious
                predecessor's work in the same domain, as he could have shown
                us how to extend Stroustrup's calculator, instead of starting
                over and thus omitting key features that Stroustrup had already
                shown us how to build.
