Margaret Atherton has written an excellent introduction to the 
work of George Berkeley, in which she systematically walks the reader through
the various stages in his argument for immaterialism. By carefully examining
what Berkeley meant in some of his most disputed passages, reading them in the
context of his other writings as well as of the philosophical milieu in which
he moved, Atherton succeeds in dispelling much of the shroud of absurdity
in which his ideas have too often been cloaked.

After a short biographical sketch of Berkeley's life,
Atherton begins addressing his writings by examining *An Essay Towards a
New Theory of Vision*, a lesser known work of his. She asks whether this work,
which appeared shortly before his two major philosophical works, was some sort of
diversion, or a coherent preliminary to them. Atherton later justifies her
choice to address this work by tying discussions in it to themes taken
up in *Principles of Human Knowledge* and *Three Dialogues Between Hylas and
Philonous*, and showing how the former can help clarify the latter.


Turning her attention to the *Principles of Human Knowledge*, Atherton is quick
to point out, as she does several times in her work, that Berkeley was *not*
addressing his arguments to "ordinary persons of common sense" but to "others,"
who "question their senses," so that at last they "sit down in a forlorn
scepticism." This is an aspect of Berkeley's work too often neglected by his
critics: he was attacking a particular philosophical theory of matter, embraced
by Descartes, Locke, and Malebranche, among others, rather than the commonsense
notion of "physical reality."


Atherton contends that Berkeley sums up his philosophical stance in the first
33 paragraphs of the *Principles*. Yet despite this concise statement of his
position, "There is, in fact, a rather surprising disarray among readers of
Berkeley when it comes to stating or even labeling the nature of the position
for which he is arguing" (p. 46). She suggests that while "immaterialism" has
its advantages, it might suggest an entirely negative program on Berkeley's
part. "'Idealism' is also a less than fully helpful label" (p. 47) because of
the many meanings attached to the term. In exploring what Berkeley *is* after,
Atherton, along the way, dismisses a common misinterpretation of Berkeley as a
"denying the existence of the real world": "It is pretty clear that Berkeley
[believes] that our ideas stand for real things, albeit mind-dependent real
things" (p. 61). Atherton concludes that, in both *New Theory* and
*Principles*, Berkeley's ultimate aim is to demonstrate that the regularity of
our visual experience, in particular, and more generally all of our experience,
should lead us to recognize God as the benevolent author of these ideas.

Atherton then proceeds to examine the "Objections" section of the *Principles*.
One important objection to *The Principles* was "whether Berkeley is entitled to endorse
the Copernican theory, to which he has made reference in recent replies, if no
one has actually perceived the motion of the earth" (p. 77).

"Berkeley's reference to "what we should perceive" is not an account of possible
motions waiting to exist if we should relocate to the heavens, but merely a
reminder that the process by which we ultimately ascribe motion to an
unobservable earth still retains the idea of motion as observed, because it is
a consequence of the laws of motion, themselves generalized from observed
motion." (p. 78)

But I think Berkeley could have made an even strong point here: we *do*
see the motion of the earth, and in exactly the same way that we see the motion
of a ship that we are sailing on: we see that motion by seeing other things
moving relative to our "vehicle" (the ship or the earth). Here it may be
apropos to bring up a story of Elizabeth Anscombe's:

"He (Ludwig Wittgenstein) once asked me: 'Why do people say it is more logical
to think that the sun turns around the Earth than Earth rotating around its own
axis?' I answered: 'I think because it seems as if the sun turns around the
Earth.' 'Good,' he said, 'but how would it have been if it had seemed as if the
Earth rotates around its own axis then?'"
-- Anscombe, 1959, p. 151

In other words, our perceptions, in fact, support the idea of a moving Earth
every bit as much as they support the idea of a motionless one, just as, when
sitting in a train car, and seeing the train on the next track "moving," our
perception supports the proposition "our train is moving past a stationary
train" every bit as much as it supports "our train is stationary and we are
perceiving another train moving past it."

In summing up the consequences of the *Principles*, Atherton writes:

"Berkeley's project has been to give an account of knowledge as we have it based
on the faculties we actually have, which can only be in us, thanks to the
bountiful gift of God...  Because the ideas that come to us can be found to
exhibit systematic connections, where are able to understand these ideas, to
make predictions, and to act on these predictions." (p. 111)

Having completed her analysis of the *Principles*,
Atherton then turns her attention to *Three Dialogues Between Hylas and
Philonous*. She notes that they are stylistically quite different: the
*Principles* is a "fairly conventional philosophical treatise" (114), while
*Three Dialogues* is "an exchange of ideas between two characters" (114).

Atherton, exemplifying her straightforward
approach in this book, explicitly states what questions the rest of her
examination of *Three Dialogues* will address:

"But is this stylistic difference the only difference between the two books?
Does Berkeley intend *Three Dialogues* to supplement the *Principles*? To
replace it? Or, is *Three Dialogues* nothing more than the *Principles*
rewritten in a more attractive style?" (114)

Early in this chapter, Atherton puts her mastery of Berkeley's entire oeuvre to
exemplary use, for example, when she uses the distiction between things
"immediately" perceived and those perceived only "mediately" from *New Theory*
to explain an otherwise puzzling passage in *Three Dialogues* (p. 120).

Some commentators have suggested that Berkeley wrote the *Three Dialogues*
because he recognized that his arguments in the *Principles* were inadequate.
Atherton convincingly argues otherwise:

"By the time Berkeley wrote *Three Dialogues*, he may have thought that he had
overestimated the sophistication of his readers. But both his target and his
strategy in PHK 1-8 and in the First Dialogue is the same... I see no reason to
conclude that he regarded his earlier position as in error or in need of
correction" (p. 145).

Turning to the Second Dialogue, Atherton argues that, although it seems on the
surface to be "quite disparate," if we look closer, we will see "a thread
running through" it (p. 147). This thread might be characterized by a question
Atherton poses: "Why would anyone say that the reality of a glove they can see
and feel is grounded or guaranteed by the existence of an unknown matter?" (p.
154-155)

Towards the beginning of her discussion of the Third Dialogue,
Atherton quotes Berkeley, characterizing a view he will refute:

"It is said that the faculties we have are few, and those designed by nature
for the support and comfort of life, and not to penetrate into the inward
essence... of things" (p. 157).

I find it very interesting, 
given how naturalist philosophers often believe they are
putting forward a novel idea when they contend that our minds evolved for
survival, not truth-seeking, that Berkeley recognized this position in 1713,
and showed that it was based upon false premises.


This book could be characterized as a 200-page argument that "Berkeley was
consistent." His philosophy only appears to change as he adapts his arguments
to his audience. As Atherton puts it, "The nature of his theory doesn't change, but
his target does, and hence different issues necessary to support his own theory
against his rival become salient" (p. 200).


At the end of the book, I was left with a few questions that I wished it had taken up:

Atherton makes it very clear that Berkeley is largely addressing contemporary
or near-contemporary philosophers, such as those mentioned above. I
wondered if he would have the same objections to hylomorphic theories of matter
as he did to those of the Cartesians. (An especially relevant question given
the recent popularity of neo-Aristotelianism.)

I also wondered what Berkeley made of animals: given that they appear to have
sensations much like ours, would he have granted them the status of spirits? If
so, how would that move fit in with his mostly orthodox Christianity?

Lastly, it was not obvious to me how Berkeley differentiated ideas from
relations, which, on their surface, might appear to be a special type of idea.

But no book can be everything to everybody, and in the space she had, Atherton
has done a remarkable job introducing readers to the work of this very
important philosopher.
