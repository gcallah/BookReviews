                Web browsers have become a primary method of delivering
                applications both inside corporate networks and from
                corporations to the external customers and suppliers. Such
                applications require efficient and secure code. But the main
                language for browser-side programming, JavaScript, is neither.
                Various attempts to improve the situation, such as Java or
                NaCl, have not succeeded.

            <p>
                This paper describes an alternative, supported by all of the
                major browser companies -- in fact, this paper's authors 
                are from Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft -- that promises
                fast and safe browser-side code execution: WebAssembly. 
                WebAssembly is meant as a compilation target for other
                languages, and promises safe, fast, platform-independent
                code that is easy decode, validate and compile.
            </p>

                The effort seems promising: by designing with a formal
                semantics for what is the "machine language"
                for a browser-hosted virtual machine, the creators have 
                achieved a clean design that is easy to reason about. By
                inclduing structured control flow concepts in their VM, they
                have designed out many common errors, such as branching into
                the middle of a multi-byte instruction.
            </p>

            <p>
                This paper is a thorough and rigorous, if dense, introduction
                to what could be a break-through in browser-side coding for the
                web. (The authors note that WebAssembly is not restricted to
                running inside a browser, so other uses of it may develop as
                well.) Only time well tell if this ambitious project will
                succceed, but for anyone engaged in web development, it is
                certainly worth tracking.
