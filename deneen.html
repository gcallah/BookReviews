                    Why Liberalism Failed

            </h3>
            <p>
                Patrick Deneen,
                Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2018.
            </p>

            <p>
                Patrick Deneen, a professor at Notre Dame
                University, has written a vitally important book for
                understanding the present crisis in Western politics.
                If this work had appeared two or three 
                years ago, it still would have been of great significance,
                but coming as it does in the wake of Brexit,
                Trump, and other shocks to the liberal consensus, its
                relevance is further enhanced.
            </p>

            <p>
                But before proceeding further in this review, a warning is in
                order: American conservatives may
                be cheered by the appearance of a
                book entitled "Why Liberalism Failed." But in
                the sense in which Deneen is using "liberalism," most American
                conservatives are actually liberals. Deneen's use is
                in fact, the one common among political theorists, for 
                whom America does not have a conservative and
                liberal party, but a right-liberal party, focused
                on free markets and free trade, and a left-liberal
                party, focused on social issues. The United States, per
                this view, has never had a "church and throne"
                conservative party such as many European countries have had.
            </p>

            <p>
                A second point that may puzzle people first
                encountering the book is the implicit claim
                of the title: Deneen did not name the book,
                "Has Liberalism Failed?" or "Will Liberalism 
                Fail?", but "Why Liberalism Failed." 
                Elite opinion continues to hold that liberalism
                (in the above-noted political theory sense)
                is not only succeeding marvelously,
                but is really the only political system even worthy 
                of consideration or respect.
                (Consider the enthusiasm for military
                adventures to intervene against any regime judged
                insufficiently liberal, or the lack of hesitation 
                shown about efforts to "reform" traditional societies
                to bring them "up" to liberal standards, despite liberal
                lip service paid to multiculturalism.) In the face of such
                consensus, one may ask how Deneen can
                blithely assume that liberalism's failure has
                already occurred? As we shall see, he has very good
                reasons for what is actually his conclusion, and not an 
                assumption at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Deneen notes that liberalism is one of the three great
                ideologies to dominate modern politics, communism and fascism 
                being the others. The latter two have been vanquished as
                serious competitors to liberalism, which had an advantage over
                them:
            </p>

            <p>
            "In contrast to its crueler competitor
            ideologies, liberalism is more insidious: as an
            ideology, it pretends to neutrality, claiming
            no preference and denying any intention of
            shaping the souls under its rule. It ingratiates by invitation
            to the easy liberties, diversions, and
            attractions of freedom, pleasure, and wealth."
            p. 5
            </p>

            <p>
                The two liberal parties in America compete by pointing to
                two seemingly opposed by factually cooperating trends.
                The right-liberal Republicans proclaim the
                danger of the dominance of society by the state.
                Meanwhile, the left-liberal Democrats highlight the
                tyranny of the market as the greatest threat to human freedom.
                Thus, each party inspires its partisan members
                by fear of the threat the other party
                represents. But despite appearances, both parties, in fact,
                jointly work to expand <i>both</i> the state and the market:
            </p>

            <p>
            "The insistent demand that we choose between protection of
            individual liberty and expansion
            of state activity masks the true
            relation between the state and market:
            that they grow constantly and necessarily together...
            Modern liberalism proceeds by making us
            both more individualist and more statist."
            p. 17
            </p>

            <p>
                But even if one accepts Deneen's conclusion about this
                relationship between state and market under liberalism,
                why should we think that liberalism is failing? Isn't our
                great material wealth, our increased longevity, and relative
                safety evidence that liberalism is succeeding, whatever its
                downsides might be? Deneen is well aware of this argument, and
                has in his arsenal an effective counter: liberalism has been
                "making progress" similar to a meth addict, who has been burning
                up his body's reserves, but responds to warnings about his
                behavior by pointing out how many times he has cleaned his room
                and dead-headed the roses this week. Those activities are
                fine things, but they are being carried out at an unsustainable
                pace. As Deneen puts it: "Liberalism has drawn down on a preliberal
                inheritance and resources that at once sustained liberalism
                but which it cannot replenish" (29-30).
            </p>

            <p>
                In what is perhaps the most important section of this work,
                Deneen identifies the false anthropology at the heart of the
                liberal error:
            </p>


            <p>
            "[For Hobbes] the state is charged with maintaining
            social stability and preventing a return to
            natural anarchy... Human beings are thus, by nature,
            nonrelational creatures, separate and autonomous."
            32
            </p>

            <p>
            Proto-liberals like Locke and Jefferson and
            modern liberals such as Mises and Rawls have all started
            from a similar place: we are first and foremost human atoms,
            who only need enter into social groups in
            so far as it suits our interest to do
            so. Our original state of being is as free individuals,
            who "contract" into social groups because we see
            it is to our advantage. As Deneen notes, "Even marriage,
            Locke holds, is finally to be understood as
            a contract whose conditions are temporary and
            subject to revision..." (33).
            </p>

            <p>
            Or, as Mises put it:
            </p>

            <p>
            "The fundamental facts that brought about cooperation, society, and
            civilization and transformed the animal man
            into a human being are the facts that work performed
            under the division of labor is more productive than
            isolated work and that man's reason is capable
            of recognizing this truth." (<i>Human Action</i>)
            </p>

            <p>
            Anyone of a religious bent would surely object to the idea
            that humans only get along with each other because they realize
            output will be higher if they do so. But
            one need not be religious to see that Mises is spouting nonsense: humans
            (and proto-humans) lived together in tight-knit
            social groups long before they could have
            been calculating the advantages of the division
            of labor. There never were "isolated... self-sufficient
            individuals" with which they could compare their "output" as members
            of a group: isolated humans were dead humans,
            not self-sufficent humans. And our chimpanzee, bonobo,
            and gorilla relatives also live in tight-knit social groups,
            as do many other animals.
            </p>

            <p>

            Deneen makes a particularly important,
            and commonly misunderstood, point in the following passage:
            </p>


            <p>
            "The 'Noble Lie' of liberalism is shattering
            because it continues to be believed and defended
            by those who benefit from it, while it
            is increasingly seen as a lie, and not an especially noble one, by
            the new servant class that liberalism has produced... But
            liberalism's apologists regard pervasive
            discontent, political dysfunction,
            economic inequality, civic disconnection, and populist
            rejection as accidental problems disconnected from systemic causes,
            because their self-deception is generated by enormous reservoirs of
            self-interest in the maintenance of the present system." 
            p. 180
            </p>

            <p>
            Often, when it is pointed out that it is
            in the self-interest of commentator X
            to take view Y, someone will respond, "No, I am sure that X
            really believes Y!" But that response misses the point: when it
            is in our self-interest to believe Y, very often, we will
            not merely feign belief in Y, but
            actually talk ourselves into really believing Y, and what's more,
            we will convince ourselves that we believe it for
            the most admirable reasons. This self-deception is
            crucial to the maintenance of our self-image as good, modern "free
            thinkers": it just happens that our "free thinking" has led us to
            precisely those views that most help us get on in life!
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Someone having gotten this far in this review might
            suspect Deneen of being a reactionary fantasist seeking 
            a return to some earlier "golden age." But he is not,
            nor does he deny liberalism's accomplishments. In his
            discussion of how we might proceed, if we accept his diagnosis 
            of liberalism as a failed ideology, he writes:
            </p>

            <p>
            "First, the achievements of liberalism must be acknowledged, and
            the desire to 'return' to a preliberal age must be eschewed. We
            must build upon those achievements while abandoning the
            foundational reasons for its failures. There can be no going back,
            only forward." p. 182
            </p>

            <p>
            This passage highlights a danger I described in
            <i>Oakeshott on Rome and America</i>:
            while for several centuries Romans simply respected and
            followed the <i>mos maiorum</i>, the way
            of the ancestors, when their
            traditions began to break down, there arose a brand new
            traditionalist ideology. Whereas previously Rome's traditions had
            been followed in an organic way, one which allowed them to also be
            organically modified, once they began to break down, a faction
            arose demanding that those traditions
            be turned into rules, and that those rules
            must be followed without deviation (and thus
            without allowing any organic response
            to changing circumstances).
            </p>

            <p>
            And this is an error that too many modern conservatives have
            committed: they wish to return to the 1950s, or the 1920s, or the
            1890s, or 1780s, or whatever other period they admire. Such a
            return, as Deneen clearly recognizes, is impossible. We can try to
            preserve the best aspects of earlier times,
            but we cannot ever recreate them.  And after all, even
            if we could, given that those earlier times
            brought about our present situation, wouldn't we
            just repeat the exact same progression that has led to the present
            situation that nostalgic conservatives deplore?
            </p>

            <p>
            Instead, to move forward, Deneen insists that, while
            we must look to the lessons of the past, and recognize
            that not all wisdom is contained in the latest
            trendy soundbite from some esteemed pundit, we have
            to admit that the present is always novel in many
            ways, and that the past provides no blueprint for how
            to act now. (The idea that we <i>could</i> act
            according to a blueprint is itself a rationalist conceit.)
            </p>

            <p>
            Perhaps most importantly, Deneen recognizes that
            what is most needed are new <i>practices</i>, and
            not new <i>theories</i>. The basic error of all
            three modern ideologies is the idea that practical
            life can be conducted on a theoretical basis. But
            this like turning to professional mathematicians for their
            street savvy. Deneen's work reaches a conslusion similar
            to the of <i>TAC</i> writer Rod Dreher's call for a
            new "Benedict option": those aware of the breakdown of the 
            "liberal world order" must first and foremost strive to create
            practical, and not theoretical, alternatives to the liberal society
            crumbling all around them.
