        Beliefs aren't rational, only actions are:

        "There is no such thing as the 'rationality' of a belief, there is
        rationality of action." -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Skin in the Game, p.
        220
        </p>

        <p>
        "How much you truly 'believe' in something can be manifested only
        through what you are willing to risk for it." -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb,
        Skin in the Game, p. 223
        </p>

        <p>
        "The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a
        class of people who are better at explaining than understanding" --
        Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Skin in the Game, p.14
