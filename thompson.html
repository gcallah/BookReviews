            <p>
                The book under consideration here is intended as the first half
                of a study on the American founding: this volume focuses on the
                Declaration of Independence and the causes of the American
                Revolution, while the second volume is intended to focus on the 
                United States Constitution. Thompson feels that the bi-partite
                division of these works, as well as their complementarity,
                reflects a fundamental reality about the United States: as he
                puts it, "The relationship between the current and the proposed
                volume is virtually identical to the connection that Abraham
                Lincoln saw between the Declaration of Independence and the
                Constitution" (xi).
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson is certainly not one to hide his light under a bushel.
                In the Preface he tells us, "I have attempted to write a book
                that is original, comprehensive, and transformative" (xiii).
                Now, in my understanding of hwat an hitorical work should be
                aiming at, it would be to determine what actually happened in
                the past, and how what happened at some particular time
                followed from what happened at earlier times. Such a work may,
                in fact, <i>wind up</i> being "original, comprehensive, and
                transformative," but to set out with those goals in mind is, I
                suggest, a deformation of the character of historical research.
            </p>

            <p>
                To elaborate upon this point, consider Thompson's distress that
                the works of Bernard Bailyn and Gordon S. Wood from the late
                sizties remain the most influential books on understanding the
                Revolution: "Surely, though, it should not remain the case that
                the most influential books on the American Revolution were
                written in the 1960s" (xii). Ok, why not? Mathematicians never
                exhibit anxiety over the fact that the most influential
                understanding of the relationship of the sides of a right
                triangle was arrived at several thousand years ago. No, the
                Pythagorean Theorem is <i>correct</i>, and mathematicians
                accept that this is right (for Euclidean spaces)
                and build on that result. Perhaps it just happens to be the
                case that Bailyn and Wood "got things right" in the 1960s:
                well, so what? And if they did <i>not</i> get things right,
                then certainly <i>how long ago</i> they made their errors is
                irrelevant. In fact, Thompson's concern about how "old" these
                works are seems to fly in the face of his repeated assertions
                that the American founders were espousing "timeless" truths. If
                their truths from the 1700s are not to be dismissed as being
                "old," then why shoud the works of Bailyn and Woods suffer this
                fate?
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson suffers from a common tendency to create a false
                dichotomy: either someone ignores historical circumstances and
                accepts "timeless" values, or they are an unprincipled
                "relativist," thinking that there are no standards of right and
                wrong, only whatever some particular society happens to regard
                as right or wrong. That this dichotomy is false can be
                illustrated with a simple analogy: let's say I want to travel
                from Hawaii to Easter Island by the fastest route possible? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, if I lived in Hawaii in 1200 A.D., the fastes route would
                have been by catamaran. But today, a jet plane can surely get
                me there faster. Does that mean that "the truth" about the
                fastest route is relative? Of course not: catamaran <i>really
                was</i> the fastest route in 1200, and jet plane <i>really
                is</i> the fastest route today. In 1200, someone who suggested
                "walking" as the fastest route from Hawaii to Easter Island
                would have been objectively wrong, just as today someone
                recommending "catamaran" would be objectively wrong. And in the
                future, when we have constructed hyper-space tunnels, the
                answer "jet plane" will be objectively wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
                In fact, it is <i>only</i> by considering historical
                circumstances that we can really, objectively determine what
                would have been the best action <i>available to an actor</i> in
                the circumstances in which they found themselves. If we want to
                criticize the Polynesians for traveling for Easter Island by
                catamaran, the only coherent way to do so is by pointing out
                that, in their actual, historical circumstances, they in fact
                had a better alternative. It is ridiculous to argue, "These
                Polynesian explorers were fools: why didn't they just take a
                jet plane?" when there were no jet planes available to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson goes on to contend that he has developed "a new
                approach to history writing that I shall call new moral
                history" (6). This approach, he says, "emphasizes thinking,
                judging, choosing, and acting individuals over large-scale
                social processes moved by unforeseen forces" (6). But to anyone
                who has studied the historiographical work of, say, Dilthey,
                Collingwood, Oakeshott, or Mises, this approach will hardly
                seem new.

                Thompson's use of "causation."
