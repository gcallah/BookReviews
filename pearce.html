                The Linguistic Structure of Berkeley's World
            </p>


            <blockquote>
            According to Berkeley, the perceived world
            <i>is itself a language</i> -- or, rather,
            a discourse in a language. Berkley intends this claim quite literally. It is
            the <i>linguistic</i> structure of the perceived
            world that our thought and speech
            about co-instantiation, physical causation, and other structural concepts aims
            to capture. In this way, I argue, Berkeley succeeds in preserving the common
            sense and scientific structure of the perceived world...
            Bodies can be regarded as a joint product of God's
            activity as speaker and our activities as
            interpreters and grammarians of nature. (2017, pp. 2-3)
