                     A Deep History of the Earliest States
                </i>

            <p>
                James C. Scott gave two lectures at Harvard in 2011 on
                domestication and the earliest states. But the discussion
                afterwards, by a panel of experts, convinced him that his
                arguments "were not remotely ready for prime time" (x). So he
                plunged into five years of research on these topics, and the
                result is this work under review.

            <p>
            "Extrinsic causes -- say, drought or climate change... -- may in
            fact be more important overall in state collapse, but intrinsic
            causes tell us more about the self-limiting aspects of early
            states. To this end, I speculate on three fault lines that are
            by-products of state formation itself. The first are the disease
            effects of the unprecedented concentrations of crops, people, and
            livestock together with their attendant parasites and pathogens...
            More insidious are two ecological effects of urbanism and intensive
            irrigated agriculture. The former resulted in steady deforestation
            of the upstream watershed of riverine states and subsequent
            siltation and floods. The latter resulted in well-documented
            salinization of the soil, lower yields, and eventual abandonment of
            arable land." (p. 31)

                In terms of long-term impact on the environment,
                Scott notes that the harnessing
                of fire and its use over the last 400,000 to alter the
                landscape might "overwhelm crop and livestock domestication"
                (p. 38). In fact, Native Americans were such prolifigate users
                of fire that its "volume in North America was such that when it
                stopped abruptly, due to the devastating epidemic that came 
                with the Europeans, the newly unchecked growth of forest
                created the illusion among white settlers that North America
                was a virtually untouched, primeval forest" (p. 39). In fact,
                the cessation of the CO<sub>2</sub> output from such burning
                may have caused the Little Ice Age.

                "Then, around 9,600 BCE, the cold snap broke and it became
                warmer and wetter again -- and fast. The average temperature
                may have increased as much as seven degrees Celsius within a
                single decade." (p. 43)
