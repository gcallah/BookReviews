        <p>
            One way of defining "rationalism" (when the term is understood as a
            flaw rather than a virtue) is that it is the attempt to replace
            experience by technique. In his important new book, historian Jerry
            Muller takes on a particular species of rationalism: our modern
            fixation on replacing expert judgment with might be described as
            "the dictatorship of the quantifiable."
        </p>

        <p>
            Muller dubs his target "metric fixation."
            In his introductory material, in his case studies, and in his
            conclusion, he highlights the many pitfalls of this fixation: once
            we restrict our focus to certain aspects of a situation that we
            <i>can</i> measure, we lose sight of important things that we
            <i>can't</i> measure; we tempt people judged by some metric to set
            aside doing their best job and instead focus on winning at the
            metric game; and we encourage cheating to meet metric standards
            often seen as arbitrary and imposed from on high.
        </p>

        <p>
            An amusing example from my own profession, software engineering,
            nicely illustrates the second point: for a little while, there was
            a management fad to measure the "performance" of software engineers
            by counting how many lines of code they wrote per day. This was
            a bizarre idea, in that generally speaking, the best solution to a
            problem involves writing the <i>fewest</i> lines of code, not the
            most. But it also led to silliness like this: if I want to set a
            variable <i>x</i> to the value five, I would naturally just write
            "<i>x</i> = 5". But once keeping my job depends on writing lots of
            lines of code, I can instead write:
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> + 1
            <br />
            Now I am "five times as productive" as if I had just written 
            "<i>x</i> = 5"!
        </p>


        <p>
            But if metrics, while useful, fall so short of their promise,
            why did they become so popular and ubiquitous? Muller explains this
            by noting that the rise of "neophyte elites" made the new holders
            of elite status anxious to justify their positions: unlikely to
            "feel secure in their judgments," they are "more likely to seek
            seemingly objective criteria by which to make decisions" (p. 40).
            Meanwhile, "when institutional establishments came under populist
            attack, they too resorted to metrics as a means of defense to
            demonstrate their effectiveness" (p. 41). Muller further contends
            that the "apotheosis of choice" added to the trend, as advocacy
            groups challenged the hegemony of experts: "The road to empowerment
            was paved with metrics" (p. 43). And the spread of computers made
            tools like spreadsheets seem like an easy way sum up an entire
            business without really understanding it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reliance on metrics in management has seemed to offer
            neophytes who are adept with numbers a quick way to beat out
            competition with years of experience, appealing to the egalitarian
            spirit of our age. As education in management gradually shifted
            from on-the-job training to education by management professors who
            may have never managed anything more complicated than their
            gradebook, the appeal of abstract methods of managing -- doing it
            "by the numbers" -- was bound to gain in popularity. An early form
            of this focus on measurements was Taylorism:
        </p>

        <p>
            "Taylorism was based on trying to replace the implicit knowledge of
            the workmen with mass production methods developed, planned,
            monitored, and controlled by managers. 'Under scientific
            management,' [Taylor] wrote, 'the managers assume... the burden of
            gathering together all the traditional knowledge which in the past
            has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying,
            tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae...
            Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the
            workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by
            management in accordance with the laws of science.' (pp.32-33)
        </p>

        <p>
            Muller goes on to describe the tremendous transformation that took
            place in the vision of the role of management, and the
            understanding of whom should become a manager, that occurred as
            formal education replaced apprenticeship and "management" came to
            be seen as mastery of a set of abstractions:
        </p>

        <p>
            "The core of managerial expertise was now defined as a distinct set
            of skills and techniques, focused upon a mastery of quantitative
            methodologies. Decisions based on numbers were viewed as
            scientific, since numbers were thought to imply objectivity and
            accuracy...
        </p>

        <p>
            "Before that, 'expertise' meant the career long accumulation of
            knowledge of a specific field, as one progressed from rung to rung
            within the same institution or business... Auto executives were
            'car guys' -- men who had spent much of their professional life in
            the automotive industry. They were increasingly replaced by
            McNamara-like 'bean counters,' adept at calculating costs and
            profit margins.
        </p>

        <p>
            "[This trend] morphed into the gospel of managerialism. The role of
            judgment grounded in experience and a deep knowledge of context was
            downplayed." (34-35)
        </p>

        <p>
            Another reason for the popularity of metric fixation in business
            is the rise of principal-agent theory, which claimed that management
            could not be trusted to act in the owners' behalf, unless their
            performance was tightly monitored with... metrics.
        </p>

        <p>
            As noted at the beginning of this review, Muller's critique of
            metric fixation is part of a larger case against what Michael
            Oakeshott and F.A. Hayek called "rationalism." And Muller
            recognizes it as such, as illustrated, for instance, by his
            description of one of the "key components" of metric fixation: "the
            belief that it is possible and desirable to replace judgment,
            acquired by personal experience and talent, with numerical
            indicators of comparative performance based upon standardized data
            (metrics)" (p. 18).  And he knows his forebears, specifically
            mentioning Oakeshott, F.A. Hayek, Michael Polanyi, and James C.
            Scott. He cites Oakeshott as criticizing rationalists for their
            belief that "the conduct of human affairs is a matter of applying
            the right formulas or recipes" (???).  He extends Hayek's argument
            against rationalistic central planning to apply also to
            "rationalist" managers:
        </p>
            
        <p>
            "Just as Soviet bloc planners
            set output targets for each factory to produce, so do bureaucrats
            set measurable performance targets for schools, hospitals, police
            forces, and corporations. And just as Soviet managers responded by
            producing shoddy goods that met the numerical targets set by their
            overlords, so do schools, police forces, and business find ways of
            of fulfilling quotas with shoddy goods of their own by graduating
            pupils with minimal skills, or downgrading grand theft to
            misdemeanor-level petty larceny, or opening dummy accounts for bank
            clients" (p. 81).
        </p>

        <p>
            Critics of Oakeshott, Hayek, and similar thinkers
            often mistake their critique of rationalism as a
            disguised defense of the status quo in politics. But Oakeshott
            himself extended the critique well beyond politics, and others have
            gone further than him: Michael Polanyi applied it to science itself,
            Ludwig Wittgenstein to philosophy, Jane Jacobs to urban planning,
            James C. Scott to forestry and agriculture, Nassim Taleb to finance
            and to religion, myself to software engineering, and here, Muller
            extends it to management and metric fixation in general.
            "Rationalism" is not mainly a political phenomenon,
            nor is it exclusively right-wing or left-wing: rather, it is an
            obsession with replacing experience and judgment with formal
            techniques, based on a mistaken understanding of what is (falsely)
            supposed to itself be a single technique called "the scientific
            method." And attacking rationalism is not a defense of whatever
            circumstances happen to be in place at present: rather, these
            attacks hold that genuine correction of current ills must be based
            on experience, not abstract theories.
        </p>

        <p>
            After discussing the history and theory of metric fixation, Muller
            turns to its contemporary practice: in particular, he
            addresses higher education, schools, medicine, policing, the
            military, business and finance, and philanthropy and foreign aid.
            In each domain he cites numerous examples of the deletrious effects
            of metric fixation, of which we will visit some highlights.
        </p>

        <p>
            Perhaps the most pernicious metric used in higher education is that
            based on the idea that "everyone should go to college." The
            original idea of the university was of a place that could educate a
            small intellectual elite in the disciplines of theology,
            philosophy, medicine, and law. Gradually that idea broadened to
            include mathematics and the natural sciences, but university
            education  was still seen as a specialized sort of activity, and
            certainly not something that was needed to train a bank clerk or a
            shop manager. But a combination of egalitarian sentiments and an
            obsession with formal education, at the expense of apprenticeship,
            led to the idea that the more formal education, and the better
            "educated" our workforce, the better off we are. As a result, young
            people who might make excellent auto mechanics or plumbers or
            hairdressers are instead shoved off to college by their "guidance"
            counsellors, whose performance is judged by measuring the
            percentage of graduating seniors who have been shoved off to
            college. Many of these students have
            little interest in analyzing Hamlet or proving
            the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, but they are marched through
            four years of college with passing grades, only to discover that
            their degrees have qualified them for corporate jobs earning them
            only a quarter or a third of what a skilled carpenter makes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another form of metric fixation that appears in universities is
            the desire to have some sort of "measurement" for all aspects of
            student learning. Courses should set out a variety of goals, and
            have a numeric score for how far the course went in meeting the
            goal. These "measurements" are then compiled, averaged, their
            variance measured, and so on. The joke here is that the numbers used as
            input are not measurements at all: professors are simply asked to
            pick a number between one and five, or one and ten, to indicate how
            close the class came to achieving the goal. Rather than being an
            actual measurement, of the sort performed with scales, rulers,
            thermometers, and so on, the "score" is simply whatever number the
            professor being asked wishes to pick! It as though quantum physics
            were done by asking a bunch of physicists "How highly would you
            rate the attraction of leptons?" and then running calculations
            based on the results. In fact, what usually happens is that
            everyone asked to "score" these categories on a scale of 1-5 puts
            down 3 or 4 for almost everything: 1 or 2 would mean you are doing
            a bad job, and 5 would look like you are exaggerating! Professors
            simply write down the numbers that they think the administrators
            doing the "measuring" want to see. And the administrators then
            report these "measurements" to the university board, as evidence
            that "We are not doing too badly, but we've still a ways to go." As
            Muller puts it, such efforts "combine hard measures of statistical
            validity with weak interest in the validity of the units of
            measurement" (72).
        </p>

        <p>
            The list of silly measurements in higher education goes on: the
            importance of researchers is "measured" by their "impact scores,"
            which count how many people cite their papers. These metrics are
            gamed by things like "citation circles," in which a group of
            authors repeatedly cites each others papers. Furthermore,
            groundbreaking scientists like Copernicus (who 50 years after his
            death had roughly three followers),
            Gregor Mendel (whose genetic theories were only understood as
            important a decade after his death), Alfred Wegener (who proposed
            continental drift 50 years before the idea became accepted), or 
            Georges Lemaître (first proponent of the "Big Bang" theory of the
            origins of the universe), would not have been recognized as of any
            importance, since their works would have achieved low impact
            scores.
        </p>

        <p>
            Perhaps even worse than the silliness of many of these measurements
            is their cost: for instance, in 2002, England spent roughly a quarter of a
            billion pounds compiling such metrics. Wouldn't this money have
            been far better spent hiring more teachers, or building better
            labs, or buying students computers? As Muller notes, "The effect
            [of this metric fixation] is to... divert spending from the doers
            to the administrators -- which usually suits the latter just fine"
            (75). University students are educated by professors, but the
            "ratio of administrators to professors... has... risen
            astronomically in recent decades" (75).
        </p>

        <p>
            Metric fixation has also wreaked havoc in education earlier than the
            college level. A prime example is the "No Child Left Behind"
            legislation passed under George W. Bush's presidency. A primary
            focus of the legislation was to close the achievement gap between
            black students and those of other races, which has not happened.
            Meanwhile, the focus on reading and mathematics scores has led to
            neglect of other subjects, and teachers devoting extensive class
            time for studying on how to pass the newly mandated, standarized
            tests. As Muller notes, "The problem does not lie in the use of
            standardized tests... Value-added testing, which measures the
            changes in student performance from year to year, has real
            utility... It is the emphasis placed on these tests as the major
            criterion for evaluating schools that creates perverse
            incentives..." (pp. 92-93).
        </p>


        <p>
            Metric fixation fares no better in the field of medicine.
            For instance, as Muller notes, if hospitals or individual
            surgeons are compensated based on the survival rate of their
            patients, this gives them a motive to refuse service to the most
            desperate cases.
        </p>


        <p>
            Police forces can respond to metric fixation in several
            counter-productive ways. If, for instance, officers are to be
            judged by a metric like "Percentage of felony complaints leading to
            an arrest," then a simple way to improve one's "stats" is to report
            felonies that promise to be hard to solve as misdemeanors
            instead. Season two, episode two of the famed television series 
            <i>The Wire</i> might have been written to illustrate the
            potentially destructive effect of metrics on policing: thirteen
            human trafficking victims are found dead in a cargo container. What
            ensues is a game of hot potato between the Baltmore city police,
            various state and county police forces, port authority police, and
            U.S. Customs officers, with each desiring to shove the case off on
            any other organization but their own. The reason? Having thirteen
            unsolved murders on their books will make their stats look bad.
            Actually achieving justice for the dead women is a distinctly
            secondary concern.
        </p>


        <p>
            The military, too, has been infected with metric fixation. Instead
            of looking to results, metric-fixated military ventures often focus
            on inputs: sorties undertaken, money distributed, foreign soldiers
            trained, or schools built. But what if the sorties aren't helping
            to defeat the enemy, the money is actually flowing into the enemy's
            coffers, the soldiers trained soon desert, and the schools are
            blown up a year after they are built? However, as Muller notes,
            even better metrics aren't a silver bullet: "use of the best
            performance metrics demands judgment based on experience" (p. 132).
        </p>


        <p>
            Business and finance have also fallen prey to metric fixation.
            A major cause of the crash of 2007-2008 was the focus on numbers,
            which could be manipulated in financial models (which showed there
            was little risk in the pyramid of derivatives being erected), 
            while the wisdom of experienced traders was dismissed as hopelessly
            behind the times. And bonuses at investment banks were tied to
            measurable achievements, meaning that "metrics provided the means,
            and pay-for-performance supplied the motivation, for undue risk
            taking under conditions of opacity" (p. 147). And Muller's final
            case study demonstrates that obsessing over metrics has yielded
            similarly poor results in the fields of philanthropy and foreign
            aid as in all of the other areas he previously examined.
        </p>

        <p>
            Muller concludes with two chapters, the first classifying the harms
            done by an over-reliance on metrics, and so acting as a summary of
            the case studies that preceded it. He includes such problems as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Goal displacement</i>: where focusing on a measured goal (think
                standardized tests) displaces a more important one
                (well-educating children) because it is measured and rewarded. 
            </li>

            <li>
                <i>Cost in employee time</i>: "Those within the organization end up
                spending more and more time compiling data, writing reports,
                and attending meetings at which the data and reports are
                coordinated."
            </li>

            <li>
                <i>Diminishing utility</i>: Initial success with metrics may encourage
                ever greater efforts to collect ever-less-useful metrics.
            </li>

                <i>Rule cascades</i>: Once it is detected that people are
                gaming a metric system, an organization may attempt to block
                such cheating with ever more elaborate systems of rules. This
                adds even more overhead to the measuring process.

                <i>Discouraging risk taking</i>: Often, a high-stakes venture
                with a big reward at the end may take years to pay off. As
                Muller notes, "The intelligence agents who ultimately located
                Bin Laden worked on the problem for years. If measured at any
                point, their productivity would have seemed to be zero" (p.
                171).

            Muller's final chapter demonstrates that he
            does not object to the use of metrics, but only to the
            worship of metrics as a panacea that can replace experience and
            judgment. He opens it by declaring, "There is nothing intrinsically
            pernicious about counting and measuring human performance" (p.
            175). and he continues by citing many beneficial uses of metrics.
            He continues by describing heuristics for differentiating a
            judicious, helpful use of metrics from "metric fixation."
            It includes such advice as focusing on measuring things that are
            not affected by the process of measuring them, distinguishing what
            is worth measuring from what can be easily measured, and noting
            that the fact that <i>some</i> metrics are helpful does not mean
            that <i>even more</i> metrics are even more helpful. Most
            importantly, he points out that metrics developed and employed by
            practitioners themselves are less liable to abuse than are those
            imposed from the top down.

            While some of the case studies offered here are a little skimpy
            -- the one of philanthropy only runs four pages, and that on the
            military only five -- nevertheless, Muller presents a very convincing
            argument that metric fixation does significant harm, and ought to
            be resisted. And because he connects metric fixation to the wider
            case against rationalism, his work is an important
            contribution to the growing literature condemning rationalism as
            the great plague of our times.
