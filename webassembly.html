                Web browsers have become a primary method of delivering
                applications both inside corporate networks and from
                corporations to the external customers and suppliers. Such
                applications require efficient and secure code. But the main
                language for browser-side programming, JavaScript, is neither.
                Various attempts to improve the situation, such as Java or
                NaCl, have not altogether succeeded.

                This paper describes an alternative, supported by all of the
                major browser companies -- in fact, this paper's authors 
                are from Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft -- that promises
                fast and safe browser-side code execution: WebAssembly. 
                It is a binary code standard for a virtual machine intended to
                be embedded in a browser, as well as 
                an accompanying "assembly-like"  language
                specification. It is primarily intended 
                as a compilation target for other
                languages, and promises safe, fast, platform-independent
                code that is easy to decode, validate and compile.
            </p>

            <p>
                The effort seems promising: by designing the language
                with formal semantics, the creators have 
                achieved a clean design that is easy to reason about. By
                inclduing structured control flow concepts in their VM, they
                have designed out many common errors, such as branching into
                the middle of a multi-byte instruction. The authors note that
                "By design, unstructured and irreducible control flow using
                <code>goto</code> is impossible in WebAssembly," a choice
                that should surely help make the VM easier to debug and secure.
                Code fetched over the Web, is, in WebAssembly, validated 
                by an "embarrassingly simple" type checking system.
                Quite importantly for its initial acceptance, WebAssembly code
                can be called from, and can call out to, JavaScript.

                This paper is a thorough and rigorous, if dense, introduction
                to what could be a break-through in browser-side coding for the
                web. (The authors note that WebAssembly is not restricted to
                running inside a browser, so other uses of it may develop as
                well.) Only time well tell if this ambitious project will
                succceed, but for anyone engaged in web development, it is
                certainly worth tracking.
