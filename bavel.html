            "the rise and dominance of markets for land, labour, and capital
            are self-undermining, as... feedback mechanisms results in welfare
            declining again and markets losing their quality in facilitating
            successful and rapid exchange, with a relative or even absolute
            downfall of the market economy in question." (pg. 2)

            "When peasants in developing countries lose their direct access to
            land and the means of production, and become reliant on markets for
            food, land, and wage labour, they can actually become more
            dependent and even more vulnerable than they would have been in a
            peasant society with limited market influence..." -- Bas van Bavel,

            "The Iraqi elites started to immobilize their wealth in <i>waqf</i>s, or
            religious and charitable foundations, partly in order to shield it
            from taxation by the state. The <i>waqf</i>, as an unincorporated and
            inalienable trust, appeared on the stage around the mid-eighth
            century and grew in importance by the ninth century, especially in
            Iraq... A major motive for the foundation of a <i>waqf</i> was the wish to
            serve a religious, charitable, or public purpose... For the
            founder, some additional advantages of using this instrument was
            that he could appoint himself as an administrator of the <i>waqf</i>, he
            could set his own salary to be paid out of the <i>waqf</i>'s funds, he
            could nominate relatives to positions paid for by the <i>waqf</i>, And he
            could designate his children as his successors. This last advantage
            help to circumvent the Islamic inheritance lawsâ€¦ What the same time
            he could shield the family property from taxation by public
            authorities." Bas van Bavel, The Invisible Hand?, p. 76

            "Output per worker around 1300 was as high as after 1348, even
            despite the windfall gains caused by the population decline of the
            Black Death..." -- Bas van Bavel, The Invisible Hand, p. 107.

            The thinking here seems to be that with fewer workers working the
            same amount of land, employing the same amount of capital, output
            per worker "should" have gone up. But this seems to ignore some
            important factors, such as the fact that many people were ill,
            while those who were not ill were often tending to the ill, or
            burying the dead, or fleeing to a remote retreat in order to avoid
            becoming ill. Once we take these countervailing factors into
            account, it is not at all obvious to me that a plague will present
            a "windfall gain" in output per worker.

            As a student of social cycles, I am always on the lookout for new instances of
            social cycle theories. And in writing my current book review, I have come
            across one: the free-market cycle. Here is the author of The Invisible Hand?,
            Bas van Bavel, describing this cycle:
            The three main cases analyzed in the book, and also the three modern cases that
            are more tentatively discussed, show a similar pattern in the interaction of
            society, market institutions, and economy. In this pattern, an originally
            positive feedback cycle -- between increasing freedom, growing factor markets,
            and economic growth -- turns into a negative one, with the increasing social
            polarization, institutional sclerosis, markets that become increasingly skewed
            towards the interests of market elites, and economic growth stagnating and
            turning into relative or absolute decline. (251)
            The cases being analyzed are ones in which factor markets -- for land, labor,
            and capital -- come to increasingly dominate the allocation of those resources.
            At first, the process yields good results: "these markets acquired favorable
            institution organization which offered security, transparency, and broad
            accessibility" (252). An important factor in these favorable results was that
            non-elite actors "had access to alternative mechanisms of exchange outside the
            market and therefore were free to choose whether to use factor markets or not"
            (253). (Such mechanisms included guilds, strong family institutions, networks
            of barter exchange, and production for home consumption from one's own land.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
            But as factor markets began to eliminate such alternatives, often through
            "outright attacks" (254) on them -- e.g., enclosure laws, or anti-guild
            legislation -- "wealth inequality rose to high, or even unprecedented levels"
            (255). To preserve their wealth, the new elites "tied it up in family
            foundations, religious foundation, or fiduciary entails" (258-259). Despite the
            fact that such events often prompted an artistic florescence, they indicated "a
            tipping point in the cycle had passed, together with other signals including a
            highly skewed distribution of property, the increasing volatility of financial
            markets, big public indebtedness, the increasing application of non-economic
            coercion, and the freezing of capital" (259).

            "For Iraq... in the early tenth century, after three centuries of intense
            market development, it had become one of the most unequal societies recorded in
            history" (261). Similar results hold for Italy around 1400, for the Low
            Countries in the 1500s and 1600s. And the less rigorous studies the author
            offers for the UK and the US more recently show the same dynamic at work.

            <p>
            Van Bavel offers a number of reasons for this result, e.g., "the wealthy
            usually have more access to information or legal expertise. With the growing
            scale and complexity of markets, the advantage this offers them also grows"
            (263). This factor weighs heavily against the anarcho-capitalist antidote to
            crony capitalism: there is no reason to believe that a financial elite cannot
            dominate the anarcho-capitalist "market" for law even more thoroughly than they
            can dominate the "production" of law in purportedly democratic societies.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Van Bavel asserts there is a predictable feedback mechanism at work here: "in
            all the cases of market economies discussed [increasing wealth inequality]
            became translated into inequality and political influence and decision-making
            power, which in its turn was used to adapt the institutional organization of
            factor markets to the interests of the wealthy" (264).
            </p>
            
            <p>
            In short, "mature market economies as a result of this feedback cycle change
            from being open and equitable to become unequal and distorted" (265).
            </p>
            
            <p>
            This is what we actually see in every single case where "free markets" come to
            dominate a society. It is all well and good for libertarians to bemoan "crony
            capitalism": but if this is the predictable outcome of their polices, they
            bemoan in vain.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The moral principles that market advocates often posit as counter-balances to
            the rise of crony capitalism are also ruled out in van Bavel's analysis:
            Moreover, the elements that reduce or compensate for negative externalities of
            market exchange they mainly be supplied by nonmarket organizations and by norms
            and values generated outside the market. In the course of time these norms and
            values, and the associated organizations, are instead eroded, as this book
            shows, their roles are usurped or superseded by the market. (266)
