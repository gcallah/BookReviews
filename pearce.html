            <h3>
                Introduction
            </h3>

            <p>
                Pearce's central thesis is that for Berkeley, the perceived
                world is, in fact, a discourse in a language -- what language,
                we shall see later -- and that our own talk about things like
                bodies, causes, and forces seek to reflect the architecture of
                that discourse. Pearce contends that "in this way, Berkeley
                succeeds in preserving the common sense and scientific
                structure of the world" (3). Thus, as Pearce interprets
                Berkeley, entities like bodies and forces are linguistic
                constructs, "part of our project of interpreting the language
                of nature" (3).
            </p>

            <p>
                Pearce describes his method of proceeding as "intellectual
                history in the service of philosophy" (3). By this, he means he
                aims to follow a middle path between a purely analytical
                approach to the "Great Dead Philosohper's" ideas, which treats
                them ahistorically, as if they were a submission to a recent
                conference on ontology or epistemology, and a purely historical
                approach, which focuses only on the context of those ideas.
                Although he seeks a balance, he insists that "the contextual
                must precede the analytic" (4). This is so, he argues, because
                these figures really are great philosophers, and therefore 
                "the positions they actually held" and "the arguments they
                actually made," when understood within the context of "the
                arguments and positions to which he was responding", are
                superior to how they might appear based on "a casual reading of
                a handful of well-known texts" (4).

                Rules and Rule-Following
            </h3>

            <p>
                In the chapter on rules and rule-following, we discover
                Berkeley as a proto-Wittgenstein, recognizing that humans often
                follow rules implicitly, many times without knowing how to even
                state the rule they are following. They do so by "suggestion",
                which anticipates Wittgenstein's insight that the ability to
                follow a rule depends upon participation in "a way of life".
                In the same vein, Berkeley also recognizes that
                "some implicit rule-following
                must... be prior to any explicit rule-following" (73).
                And, as a proto-Ryle, Berkeley recognizes that the ability to
                follow a rule "is really an ability, or a kind of
                know-<i>how</i>" (75).
            </p>

            <p>
                We also find that Berkeley anticipated C.S. Peirce's division of
                signs into indices, icons, and symbols, as he contended that
                one idea can suggest another "by likeness [icon], by necessary
                connexion [index]... or by arbitrary convention [symbol]" (69).
                (The correspondence is not exact, however, since Berkeley
                includes a fourth category he calls "geometrical inference".)
            </p>

            <p>
                The upshot of this chapter is that, for Berkeley,
                "only rule-following can underlie genuine
                regularity", it follows that "the laws of nature can be
                nothing other than the rules followed by God" (75).
                "'Force', 'gravity', 'attraction', and similar terms are useful
                for reasoning, and for calculations about motion and moving
                bodies" (84), but they do not reflect ultimate, metaphysical
                realities.

                The Linguistic Structure of Berkeley's World
            </h3>


            <p>
            Pearce argues that, for Berkeley, "bodies" are linguistic constructions
            built up from our phenomenal experience, and that causal talk, in
            everyday life and in physics, is an extension of that sort of
            operation. But Berkeley does not therefore dismiss such talk. The
            reason is twofold:
            </p>

            <ol class="nested">
                <li>
            First of all, to model things this way is useful: it helps us "in
            the pursuit of happiness, which is the ultimate end and design...
            that sets rational agents at work" (204).
                </li>

                <li>
            But these ideas are also true, in an important sense: they reflect
            the underlying reality of "the regular ordering of ideas instituted
            by God, i.e., the linguistic or grammatical structure of the divine
            language of nature. Our talk about bodies aims to capture the
            lexicon of this language, and our talk about causes, laws, and
            forces aims to capture its syntax" (204).
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                Pearce has penned an impotrant new contribution to Berkeley
                scholarship, one that aims to clear up many of the supposed
                paradoxes in Berkeley's thought that have puzzled other
                scholars. This reviewer believes he has largely succeeded in
                that task. But whether or not one accepts that conclusion, this
                is a work that cannot be ignored in future work on this "Great
                Dead Philosopher."
