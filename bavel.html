            "the rise and dominance of markets for land, labour, and capital
            are self-undermining, as... feedback mechanisms results in welfare
            declining again and markets losing their quality in facilitating
            successful and rapid exchange, with a relative or even absolute
            downfall of the market economy in question." (pg. 2)

            "The Iraqi elites started to immobilize their wealth in waqfs, or
            religious and charitable foundations, partly in order to shield it
            from taxation by the state. The waqf, as an unincorporated and
            inalienable trust, appeared on the stage around the mid-eighth
            century and grew in importance by the ninth century, especially in
            Iraq... A major motive for the foundation of a waqf was the wish to
            serve a religious, charitable, or public purpose... For the
            founder, some additional advantages of using this instrument was
            that he could appoint himself as an administrator of the waqf, he
            could set his own salary to be paid out of the waqf's funds, he
            could nominate relatives to positions paid for by the waqf, And he
            could designate his children as his successors. This last advantage
            help to circumvent the Islamic inheritance lawsâ€¦ What the same time
            he could shield the family property from taxation by public
            authorities." Bas van Bavel, The Invisible Hand?, p. 76
