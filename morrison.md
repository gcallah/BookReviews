# Keynes, Churchill, and the Governance of Economic Beliefs

James Ashley Morrison

"Just as the earliest people conjure the supernatural as the superintendents of
the seasons, so to have modern people created economic religions to describe
some meaning, purpose, and direction to the forces that govern our lives." (7)

This is historically inaccurate, as deities like the Greek pantheon were not
super natural, but were what Eric Voegelin calls “intra-cosmic gods,“ very much
a part of the natural order. And it relies upon the long discredited view of
religion as merely an early and very bad attempt at doing science.

Morrison makes a great deal of the fact that "the" gold standard meant very
different things in different times and places. No doubt he is right about
that: but given it is so, how can one use this specific incident involving this
particular version of the gold standard to dismiss all of the multifarious
version?


Morrison discusses how Burke thought that governance should proceed “‘upon the
principle of reference to antiquity.’”

He then goes on to say “this was ‘the Whig[s’] interpretation of history,” and
cites Butterfield. But this is pretty much the opposite of what Butterfield men
by “the Whig interpretation of history,” which saw History as steady progress
forward from a benighted antiquity.


Morrison makes the point that attitudes towards monetary policy resembled
religious beliefs. Then he makes it again. And again. And again. Words like
“dogma,“ “creed,“ and “heresy“ are littered liberally throughout the text. This
reader cannot help but feel that Morrison took an interesting contention and
belabored it so much that he was tempted to reject it simply because it was
being pushed on him so often.
