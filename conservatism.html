                The series editors describe the series of which this book is a
                part as follows:
                "'Textual Moments in the History of Political Thought'...
                is designed to encourage fresh readings of thematically selected
                texts. Each chapter identifies a key textual moment or passage
                and exposes it to a reading by an acknowledged expert" (x).
                Aside from the use of the word 'exposes,' which strikes me
                as a triumph of trendy jargon over clarity, I also wonder
                whether the brief space allocated to each "reading" is really
                sufficient to accomplish the goal of the series: the 
                six or seven pages allocated to each chapter hardly seems
                enough to convey a novel view of, say, Plato or Burke. What 
                the authors <i>are</i> generally able to accomplish is to give
                a brief summary of the sense in which a particular thinker
                may be regarded as conservative, and discuss to what extent
                such a label actually captures his thought. Now, that is
                a worthwhile achievement -- as my grandmother would have said,
                "that's nothing to sneeze at" -- but it falls short of the 
                grander goal of the series editors.

                I came to this book as a Frank Rizzo <i>tabula rasa</i>, 
                having been too young and removed from Philadelphia politics
                to have been aware of him as the city's mayor in the 1970s,
                and having read nothing about him since. As such, I was
                surprised to find the author writing, in the introduction:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                To his critics, Rizo was little more than a villain. They saw
                him as an enemy of civil rights, a bully, a racist, a sexist,
                a homophobe, and a mean-spirited patriarchical figurehead of a
                regressive political order. He was all those things. (p. 3)
            </blockquote> 

            <p>
                So, not knowing anythin about Rizzo, I was in no posiiton to
                evaluate if any of these accusations were true. No, what
                surprised me was to find this in the <i>introduction</i>
                to the book: Shouldn't the confirmation of these accusations 
                have been in the book's <i>conclusion</i>, rather than in its
                introduction. Ought not an honest, scholarly examination of
                Rizzo's career begun by asking, say, "Was he all those things?"
                rather than positing that he was, without further ado?
