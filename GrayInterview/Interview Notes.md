Neither Jesus nor Buddha "put together a coherent argument." And often neither did Plato! (Gadamer)


Newtonian physics did not *discover* that an object in motion tends to stay in motion: it presupposed this.

As an Oakeshottian, I understand every "special science" makes presuppositions: so no objection to Darwin's!



You claim that "While history is not the unfolding of reason, there can be logic in particular situations." (22) But he does not provide any argument for believing that a process that is non-rational should present us with "particular situations" that are amenable to logical analysis: how could such situations arise? How can we identify them?

Why wouldn't the (more?) consistent critic of Hegel say you just haven't gone far enough?
