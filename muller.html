            One way of defining "rationalism," the modern tendency critiqued by
            such figures as Michael Oakeshott, F.A. Hayek, and Michael Polanyi,
            is that it is the attempt to replace experience by technique. In
            his important new book, historian Jerry Muller takes on a
            particular species of rationalism: our modern fixation on replacing
            expert judgment with a sort of rule by quantifiable entities.
