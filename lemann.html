            <p>
                Nicholas Lemann has written an important book offering a
                plausible explanation as to why, despite the "macro" success of
                the American economy during recent years, many particular
                Americans feel they have been the victims of this "success." He
                is an adept story-teller, and has found paradigmatic tales
                of why a booming Dow Jones Industrial Average does not tell the
                entire story of recent US economic history. Furthermore, his
                fingering of the "culprits" in this crime is, I believe,
                largely accurate. And he even offers a good suggestion for an
                approach that might help to right our ship of state, namely,
                abandoning our reliance on a single, rationalistically arrived
                at, method for governing society, and returning to a more
                pluralistic, "competition-of-interest-groups" basis for
                achieving social order, in line with that suggested by, say,
                the authors of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nevertheless, despite my agreement in large with both Lemann's
                diagnosis of the cause of our recent social ailments, and with
                his prescription for curing them, I find this book highly
                problematic, as the author is far too "loosey-goosey" with the
                evidence he brings to bear for his case, and with his
                descriptions of how various aspects of the situation he
                describes actually function. A bad argument for a true
                conclusion is still a bad argument, and it is especially
                encumbent on those who agree with the conclusion in question to
                reject bad arguments for it, lest the conclusion be dismissed
                solely on the basis of the badness of those particular
                arguments.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lemann organizes his book into three major sections, based upon
                the three main ways American society was thought to be
                primarily organized, by the most influential thinkers in each
                period. The first organizing principle, operative in the first
                half of the 20th century, held that it is institutions that
                matter most: the, the focus of social analysis, as well as that
                of legislation seeking to transform social conditions, should
                be aimed at institutions such as corporations, labor unions,
                political parties, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                But, as Lemann documents, from the 1970s onwards, largely under
                the influence of academic theories in economics and finance, a
                view gained ascendancy, one which held that the primary focus of
                policy should be on permitting any and all "voluntary"
                transactions, regardless of the effect of those transactions on
                existing social relations. The theoretical underpinning of this
                view was that freeing markets from all of the "artificial"
                restrictions that labor unions, domestic manufacturers, and
                other interest groups had bound them with would lead to greater
                "consumer utility." Of course, such analysis was far from
                "value-free" as its proponents suggested it was: in fact, it
                reduced the value of a human life to the value of what that
                human could consume during that life, and wiped out the fact
                that real people often are more concerned with what they can
                <i>contribute</i> to society than they are with what they can
                consume.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lemann declares that "Economics and politics usually operate
                together as society's main organizing principles" (4). This
                sort of reductionist thinking has been popular at least since
                Marx (and with many who are not Marxists), but it is not true:
                it is a shared understanding of the nature of reality
                that is a society's main organizing principle. Only for a
                society that has already decided that, say, self-interest is
                the guiding principle of life do economic factors
                exert as much influence as they do in ours.

                Describing changes occurring in the Chicago neighborhood known
                as "Chicago Lawn" towards the end of the 20th century, Lemann
                describes the situation as "barely controlled chaos," with
                "panicked" whites selling and moving out, and "frightened"
                blacks (frightened by the decline of the neighborhood in which
                they had been living) buying and moving in. And what was the
                outcome of all of the panic, fear, and chaos? "In 1990 it was
                still just over half white; by 2000 it was just over half
                black" (7). Throughout this book we only get references for
                direct quotations: everything else, we should just take on
                faith. So I don't know the exact numbers Lemann was looking at
                when he wrote this passage, but it sure looks like he is saying
                that a neighborhood shifting from, say, 51% white, to 49%
                white, over <i>a ten-year period</i>, is "barely controlled
                chaos" and a result of "panic." He also claims that black
                buyers bought in at "prices far above what the fleeing whites
                had sold for" (7). As mentioned, we are never pointed to any
                sources for anything other than direct quotes, but I, for one,
                certainly wanted to see some evidence as to how "far above"
                these prices actually were, as Lemann's contention implies a
                significant obtuseness on the part of both the white sellers
                and the black buyers, who apparently were unable to check
                recent sale prices and realize they were being had.

                (Given that anyone trying to argue that bankers might have
                inordinate influence on modern social affairs is usually
                accused of anti-semitism before they can finish their sentence,
                a point Lemann makes in passing is worth noting: one of the
                earliest, influential attacks on bankers' hidden control over
                economic life was <i>Other People's Money and How the Bankers
                Use It</i>, was penned by Louis Brandeis... who was Jewish.)

            <p>
                In describing the milieu in which the "transaction man"
                himself, Michael C. Jensen, earned his PhD in the University
                of Chicago economics department, Lemann notes that "Friederich
                Hayek had moved to the university... in 1950" (102). True, but
                he had departed in 1962 for the University of Frieburg, and
                furthermore, the Chicago economics department had rejected
                Hayek as a member of their faculty, so that he wound up at the
                university's Committee on Social Thought. He also describes
                Milton Friedman as "the conservative economist," and as Hayek's
                prot&eacute;g&eacute;, both descriptions Friedman surely would have
                rejected.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lemann continues by noting that economists Modigliani and
                Miller had argued "that the value of a company has nothing to
                do with the standard questions that professional investors had
                for years considered essential in deciding whether to buy a
                stock" (105). A few lines later, he cites Eugene Fama as
                holding that "well-functioning financial markets will set the
                price of a stock accurately" (105). He doesn't notice that
                these two ideas contradict each other: if "professional
                investors" were deciding whether to buy a stock consistently
                had "nothing to do with" the stock's actual value, then market
                prices for a stock would generally have been wildly inaccurate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arguing for Jensen's blindness to counter-evidence to his
                "efficient markets" theory, Lemann cites Keynes's example of
                the stock of ice companies trading higher in the summer than in
                the winter. (If this were true, it would suggest markets were
                "irrational," since winter investors ought to have foreseen
                that summer was coming in a few months, and vice-versa for
                summer investors.) But Lemann failed to investigate whether
                Keynes's bald declaration was true: Henry Hazlitt did do so,
                and in <i>The Failure of the New Economics</i>, he found that
                actual data on the few ice companies he could find trading on
                the stock market did not at all support Keynes's contention. He
                admitted that his thin evidence certainly did not disprove
                Keynes's contention, but noted that since Keynes had presented
                exactly <i>no</i> evidence for his contention, that the burden
                of proof now was firmly in Keynes's court.
            </p>

            <p>
                As evidence of the evils stemming from
                the abundance of derivatives that
                were spawned during "The Time of Transaction Man" (the title of
                Lemann's fourth chapter), he mentions that "Enron... collapsed
                because of losses incurred from... derivatives trading" (171).
                But Professor of Law Frank Portnoy, testifying as an expert
                witness before the US Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,
                asserted:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "How did Enron lose so much money?...  the basic answer is now
                apparent: Enron was a derivatives trading firm; it made
                billions trading derivatives, but it lost billions on virtually
                everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic
                bandwidth, retail gas and power, water systems, and even
                technology stocks.  Enron used its expertise in derivatives to
                hide these losses."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                It may be useful to note here that Portnoy was <i>highly</i>
                critical of Enron's use of derivatives, and of the lack of
                regulation on derivative trading in general. But even such a
                critic, who actually spent a large amount of time studying this
                case, did not try to claim that Enron folded because of
                <i>losses</i> in derivatives trading: no, the derivatives
                trading was the only part of the company making money. And Greg
                Kaza and I cited Portnoy in <i>Reason Magazine</i> in our 2004
                article there
                (https://reason.com/2004/02/01/in-defense-of-derivatives-2/),
                so this fact was easily accesible from a popular
                magazine article. That Lemann, in 2019, is claiming that Enron
                fell due to <i>losses</i> from derivative trading leads me to
                suspect a serious lack of research on his part. On the other
                hand, perhaps he has some source that contradicts Portnoy...
                but since his citations are so minimal, how could this poor
                reviewer find out if this is so?
            </p>

            <p>
                A couple of pages later, Lemann claims:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "if you place a bet on the future directional movement of the
                instrument by buying a derivative, and you're right, you can
                make a lot more money than if you owned the instrument itself.
                And what happens if you're wrong is similarly magnified..."
                (175)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This quote displays a fundamental misunderstanding of options.
                If I want to speculate that XCORP stock, which is currently at
                $100, will soon "go through the roof," I can buy, say, 100
                shares of the stock for $10,000. Or, I can pay, perhaps, $500
                on an option to purchase 100 shares of the stock at $110.
                If the stock goes to $0, if I bought the shares, I lose my
                entire $10,000. But if I bought the option contract, I lose
                only the $500 I paid for the option. Buying options is, most
                fundamentally, a way to <i>limit</i> one's downside when
                betting on a certain market outcome. The cost is that, if the
                stock does go up, my profit is $500 less than what it would
                have been otherwise (plus the fact that I don't gain from the
                rise from $100 to $110, in our example).
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, trading in derivatives <i>can</i> be very risky. 
                For instance, <i>selling</i> "uncovered" puts is a famous way
                to achieve bankruptcy. But this is the opposite case of
                Lemann's: in buying a derivative, one only risks what one pays
                for it. It is selling derivatives, without a hedge against a
                movement against one's position, that is especially risky. It
                is quite surprising that an author who wishes to explain the
                risks involved in derivative trading to a popular audience does
                not seem to grasp this distinction.
