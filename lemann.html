                Lemann declares that "Economics and politics usually operate
                together as society's main organizing principles" (4). This
                sort of reductionist thinking has been popular at least since
                Marx (and with many who are not Marxists), but it is not true:
                it is a shared understanding of the nature of reality
                that is a society's main organizing principle. Only for a
                society that has already decided that, say, self-interest is
                the guiding principle of life do economic factors
                exert as much influence as they do in ours.

                Describing changes occurring in the Chicago neighborhood known
                as "Chicago Lawn" towards the end of the 20th century, Lemann
                describes the situation as "barely controlled chaos," with
                "panicked" whites selling and moving out, and "frightened"
                blacks (frightened by the decline of the neighborhood in which
                they had been living) buying and moving in. And what was the
                outcome of all of the panic, fear, and chaos? "In 1990 it was
                still just over half white; by 2000 it was just over half
                black" (7). Throughout this book we only get references for
                direct quotations: everything else, we should just take on
                faith. So I don't know the exact numbers Lemann was looking at
                when he wrote this passage, but it sure looks like he is saying
                that a neighborhood shifting from, say, 51% white, to 49%
                white, over <i>a ten-year period</i>, is "barely controlled
                chaos" and a result of "panic." He also claims that black
                buyers bought in at "prices far above what the fleeing whites
                had sold for" (7). As mentioned, we are never pointed to any
                sources for anything other than direct quotes, but I, for one,
                certainly wanted to see some evidence as to how "far above"
                these prices actually were, as Lemann's contention implies a
                significant obtuseness on the part of both the white sellers
                and the black buyers, who apparently were unable to check
                recent sale prices and realize they were being had.

                In describing the milieu in which the "transaction man"
                himself, Michael C. Jensen, earned his PhD in the University
                of Chicago economics department, Lemann notes that "Friederich
                Hayek had moved to the university... in 1950" (102). True, but
                he had departed in 1962 for the University of Frieburg, and
                furthermore, the Chicago economics department had rejected
                Hayek as a member of their faculty, so that he wound up at the
                university's Committee on Social Thought. He also describes
                Milton Friedman as "the conservative economist," and as Hayek's
                protege [ACCENTS], both descriptions Friedman surely would have
                rejected.

                Lemann continues by noting that economists Modigliani and
                Miller had argued "that the value of a company has nothing to
                do with the standard questions that professional investors had
                for years considered essential in deciding whether to buy a
                stock" (105). A few lines later, he cites Eugene Fama as
                holding that "well-functioning financial markets will set the
                price of a stock accurately" (105). He doesn't notice that
                these two ideas contradict each other: if "professional
                investors" were deciding whether to buy a stock consistently
                had "nothing to do with" the stock's actual value, then market
                prices for a stock would generally have been wildly inaccurate.

                Arguing for Jensen's blindness to counter-evidence to his
                "efficient markets" theory, Lemann cites Keynes's example of
                the stock of ice companies trading higher in the summer than in
                the winter. (If this were true, it would suggest markets were
                "irrational," since winter investors ought to have foreseen
                that summer was coming in a few months, and vice-versa for
                summer investors.) But Lemann failed to investigate whether
                Keynes's bald declaration was true: Henry Hazlitt did do so,
                and in <i>The Failure of the New Economics</i>, he found that
                actual data on the few ice companies he could find trading on
                the stock market did not at all support Keynes's contention. He
                admitted that his thin evidence certainly did not disprove
                Keynes's contention, but noted that since Keynes had presented
                exactly <i>no</i> evidence for his contention, that the burden
                of proof now was firmly in Keynes's court.
