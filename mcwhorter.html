                John H. McWhorter,
                Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, 2016
            </h3>

            <p>
            John H. McWhorter is a linguist at Columbia University, and a
            fascinating and sometimes controversial figure. For instance,
            although he describes himself as "a cranky liberal Democrat,"
            he also wrote a book,
            <a
                href="https://fee.org/articles/losing-the-race-self-sabotage-in-black-america-by-john-h-mcwhorter/"><i>Losing
                    the Race</i></a>, which claims that African-American
            culture is partly to blame for the relatively poor performance of
            African-Americans in school and work life. That book made him
            popular with conservatives, and led The Manhattan Institute to name
            him a contributing editor to its publication <i>City Journal</i>.
            On the other hand, he is a vigorous defender of "Black English" as
            a perfectly valid form of English, just as grammatical as
            "standard" American English. (That is a position that
            traditionalist conservatives <i>ought</i> to embrace, first of all
            because it is correct, and secondly because it recognizes the
            priority of concrete ways of life over abstract rules. But alas,
            too many conservatives have mistaken the position of 19th-century
            grammar rationalists as being conservative.)
            </p>

            <p>
            In addition to these positions that have brought him into the
            public eye, McWhorter is a serious linguist, specializing in
            language change and Creole languages, and conversant in 
            Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch,
            Swedish and Hebrew. (Source:
            http://www.racematters.org/mcwhorter.htm)
            In <i>The Language Hoax</i>, McWhorter takes on an important and
            contentious view that has been kicking around linguistics and the
            social sciences since at least the 18th century, a theory which has
            sometimes been called the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis" (itself a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">controversial
                term</a>). The essence of this theory is that the worldview of
            we humans is... well, here things get murky: determined by?
            strongly influenced by? somewhat influenced by?... the language we
            speak.
            </p>

            <p>
            Evaluating the case for and the case against "Whorfianism" (the
            term McWhorter prefers to "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis") is confounded
            by the fact that various proponents and opponents of Whorfianism
            have used their support or opposition in all sorts of polemical and
            politically charged ways. For instance, in the early 19th-century, 
            Wilhelm von Humboldt argued that "inflectional" languages, those
            with lots of prefixes and suffixes that modify a word's grammatical
            role, are superior to other langauges, and that is why their
            speakers have come to dominate the world
            (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity#German_Romantic_philosophers).
            But that idea cannot survive even moderate scrutiny: English is far
            less inflected than German or Italian, so why is so much more
            of the world Anglophone rather than Germanophone or Italophone?
            And since some of the worlds most inflected languages were spoken
            by Native Americans, why didn't the groups that spoke those
            languages wind up dominating the globe?
            </p>

            <p>
            Once I got a sense of where McWhorter was going with this
            work, I got the sense that the book's title was the creation of the
            marketing department of the publisher, rather than having been
            chosen by McWhorter: nowhere Between the front and back covers does
            McWhorter actually suggest that anyone is deliberately tricking
            people into thinking Whorfianism is true. Fromn the evidence he
            brings forward, the worst that could be said of enthusiastic
            Whorfians is that they are guilty of wishful thinking: because they
            <i>like</i> the idea that the languages of various "primitive"
            people actually demonstrate that they have insights into reality
            that "Westerners" lack. A famous example is the notion that
            Eskimoes have "100 words for snow." Despite this legend
            <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3497">
            apparently being false</a>, many people take a fancy to it
            because they think it shows how "in tune with nature"
            non-Westerners can be.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            McWhorter offers the example of the Amazonian Tuyuca,
            who use "evidential markers" extensively in their language. Their
            grammar requires speakers to make their evidence for some claim
            explicit. For instance, if the claim they are making is based on
            their <i>seeing</i> the event in question -- in English we might
            say, "I see it is raining" -- in Tuyuca the suffix <i>Ã­</i> would
            be attached to some word in that sentence. (I haven't learned
            enough Tuyuca from McWhorter's description to be sure of which
            one.) If, instead the assertion is based on hearing ("I hear the
            rain falling") there is a different suffix used. If they are just
            surmising it is raining ("From the wet streets, I'd guess it is
            raining"), there is another suffix, and if it is just the word of
            others ("They tell me it is raining"), there is yet another.
            Whorfians tend to like stories like this: "See how these people you
            might think of as savages are actually scrupulous evalutors of
            evidence!"
            </p>

            <p>
            However, McWhorter argues, this kind of argument relies on
            cherry-picking evidence. Bulgurian and Turkish have evidential
            markers, while Greek and Persian do not. Are
            Bulgarians and Turks really more sensitive to the sources of claims
            than are Greeks and Persians? McWhorter presents a wealth of
            evidence suggesting it is unlikely that we will find any
            macro-level explanation for the enormous diversity of phonetic and
            grammatical features in human language.
            </p>

            <p>
            But McWhorter commits a serious error in assigning the cause of
            this profligate variety: "In
            fact, there is a coherent explanation... That explanation is, quite
            simply, chance" (43). This is nonsense, albeit common nonsense.
            "Chance" is not an explanation for anything: chance is the word we
            use for happenings we <i>can't</i> explain. In cases such as
            the presence of evidential markers in the Tuyuca language,
            McWhorter is fighting against the Whorfian view that there is
            always a cultural/environmental explanation
            for the features of a language. And, as mentioned above, he
            makes a strong case that things are not so.  
            </p>

            <p>
            But there is <i>some</i> explanation for how language
            features arose, even if it not at the level the Whorfians would
            like it to be: in the case of evidential markers in Tuyuca,
            perhaps (and here I am merely offering a purely imaginary example
            here!) a long-lived chief was an especially suspicious fellow, and
            some little tic led him to put small sounds of doubt at the end of
            otherwise factual statements when he questioned their factualness.
            Now, this would be a fact of history that is long lost, and that we
            probably have no hope of ever recovering. And to that extent,
            McWhorter would be accurate if he had said, "It <i>might as
            well</i> have been the flip of a coin that determined how
            evidential markers arose in Tuyuca." But, of course, coin flips
            themselves are not chance events! Or, rather, saying they are a
            chance event is an expression of our ignorance of, and, indeed,
            despair at ever detecting, what really caused a coin to come up
            heads or tails on some particular flip.
            </p>

            <p>
            Consider the opening toss before a football game, which determines
            who kicks off. Such tosses are governed by "chance" from the point 
            of view of the players and referees involved. But whether the coin
            comes up heads or tails is, in fact, determined by the force and
            angle of the refs flip, the air resistance, the gusts of wind that
            impact it, the participants' movements, and so on. If anyone
            involved could exactly determine the influence of all of those
            factors and could rapidly calculate them, they could say for
            sure whether the coin would land on heads or tails. It is the
            participants inability to do such calculations that makes the coin
            flip, from their point of view, chance, and a fair way to decide
            who kicks off. But "chance" is certainly not an <i>explanation</i>
            for why the coin landed as it did: it is the admission that the
            participants <i>can't</i> explain it.
            </p>

            <p>
            McWhorter goes on to, about what he sees as the chance nature of
            these languages changes, "There is a comfort in this reality" (43).
            Well, as Rocky Rococo would say, "Maybe yes, maybe no." But in
            either case, so what? Are we now weighting the degree of comfort
            scientific theories provide in our evaluations of them? Should we
            give a couple of points to Ptolemy vis-a-vis Copernicus if people 
            are more comfortable with a stationary earth? He brings similar,
            one would think irrelevant, considerations into play a bit later,
            when he writes, "Whorfianism, here, seems dangerous" (78) (in
            making the Chinese speakers seem less clear-headed than English
            ones). But if Whorfianism is <i>true</i>, then even if it is
            "dangerous" in the way McWhorter suggests, well...? What? We should
            surpress it? I thought scientists were proud iconclasts, who
            followed their theories however many idols were crushed along the
            way?
            </p>

            <p>
            To be fair to McWhorter, he is attempting to discourage those who
            are inclined to believe in Whorfianism because of what they think
            are its socio-political entailments. And McWhorter is attempting to
            alert them to the fact that those entailments don't always entail
            what Whorfians want them to do. Fair enough, but wouldn't it have
            been a more accurate rejoinder to tell the Whorfians that it is
            invalid to judge scientific theories based upon whether we like
            their social implications?
            </p>

            <p>
            McWhorter also attacks the idea that a language, like English,
            shapes one's worldview with arguments like, "if English conditions
            a worldview, then it that has to be a worldview that encompasses
            the frames of reference of that Jersey City boy, Mary Tyler Moore,
            Margaret Cho, William Jennings Bryan, and Sting... Clearly, that is
            a worldview so general as to be equivalent, essentially, to simply
            being human" (133). Well, let's play a similar game: what in the
            world, besides "simply being human," could possibly unite the
            worldviews of Mel Gibson, Kobe Bryant, CorazÃ³n Aquino, Louis
            Pasteur, John von Neumann, Aaron Neville, Graham Greene, and Mark
            Wahlberg? Well, in fact, they all are (or were) Catholics, and if
            <i>that</i> doesn't shape one's worldview, what possibly could?
            McWhorter would <i>appear</i> to have conflated <i>shaping</i> a
            worldview with completely <i>determining</i> a worldview, and
            ridicules Whorfian claims that language might do the former on the
            basis of the fact that it certainly does not do the latter.
            </p>

            <p>
            However, things are not that simple, for towards the end of this
            book, McWhorter insists that it is a misinterpretation of his
            stance to think one can defease it by noting "that no one has claimed
            that language absolutely determines thought" (167). And he admits
            that "no Whorfians make such simplistic claims" (167). But once
            McWhorter admits <i>those</i> points, then what are we to make of
            his list of English speakers? If speaking English, like being
            Catholic (or being Marxist, or being a jazz musician, or being a
            racial or religious minority in one's society, or being gay, etc.),
            is only supposed to be (per the Whorfians, or their equivalents in
            other fields) a <i>factor</i> making one "significantly more
            'likely' to think in certain ways" (167), then Whorfianism is just
            a matter of what we call "significant." McWhorter says this more
            restrained Whorfian claim is "highly fraught" (167), but that is
            not what this work has demonstrated: instead, he has shown that
            <i>more extreme</i> Whorfian claims about the significance of
            language's impact on thought don't bear close scrutiny. (And this
            reviewer wonders why McWhorter puts 'likely' in scare quotes: does
            he believe the notion of likelihood is also 'fraught'?) Since
            McWhorter admits that moderate Whorfian claims have been
            borne out in rigorous testing, it would seem the sensible
            conclusion would be, "Extreme Whorfianism is false; less extreme,
            particular Whorfian claims may or may not be true: we'd have to
            test them out to see." But <i>that's</i> a claim no Whorfian would
            dispute. So why the extreme antipathy to Whorfianism that McWhorter
            sometimes expresses?
            </p>

            <p>
            Although McWhorter has taught me much about linguistics (I have
            gone through several of his digital courses) and I undertook this
            review because, as a fan of his work in general, I wanted to see
            what he had to say about Safir-Whorf, nevertheless, I fear he has
            muddled a number of propositions together in his discussion of
            Sapir-Whorf, or Whorfianism, a muddle which becomes apparent on the
            last page of this book (168), where he asserts:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    "Rejecting" Sapir-Whorf is "preferable" to accepting it,
                    for various political/ethical reasons.
                </li>

                <li>
                    "Science does not support" Sapir-Whorf as it is popularly
                    interpreted.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Sapir-Whorf "just isn't necessary," since "languages are
                    fascinating in their own right."
                </li>

                <li>
                    Rejecting Sapir-Whorf is "more truly progressive" than is
                    accepting it.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            But points 1, 3, and 4 are entirely irrelevant to deciding if
            Whorfianism is scientifically true. At most, they might bear on why
            people might embrace Sapir-Whorf despite a lack of evidence. And,
            as McWhorter accurately notes, the pop embrace of Whorfianism
            <i>is</i> more enthusiastic than the evidence warrants... but
            <i>how much</i> more enthusiastic than warranted is surely a matter
            of rigorously testing one claim after another, rather than
            asserting how "more truly progressive" is rejecting Sapir-Whorf.
            </p>

            <p>
            In short, while this work contains a wealth of interesting
            linguistic findings, and ceratinly serves to debunk the more
            extreme Whorfian claims that we sometimes see in the popular press,
            it would have been a more coherent work had it clearly separated
            its scientific claims, its psychological analysis of the motives
            for strong Whorfian positions, and its political advocacy of "why
            the world looks the same in any language." Instead, since these
            issues are mingled together throughout this book, it leaves the
            reader wondering to what extent McWhorter has allowed his position
            on one or more of these questions to influence his stance on the
            others.
