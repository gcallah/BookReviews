                "The assumption that humans of the Stone or Bronze Age would 
                have had only the most primitive knowledge of nature may be
                flattering to our progressivist self-image. But it has little
                plausibility since Stone Age humans were already fully
                developed members of the species <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and it is
                incompatible with recent research. The environmental and societal
                problems that the early <i>Homo sapiens</i> had to face were
                incomparably greater than the challenges facing our contemporary
                scientists. These problems has to be solved with the most
                primitive means, often without any division of labor or
                specialized skills, and the solutions arrived at indicate a
                level of intelligence and sensitivity that is clearly not inferior
                to ours." -- pp. 5-6

                "An animated world, divine intervention, the 'openness' of the soul's life are
                not preconceptions or errors or results of a superficial approach, but clearly
                recognizable components of this experience of the world, and their elimination
                constitutes an elimination of important knowledge." -- p. 90
