But I think Berkeley could have made an even strong point here: we *do*
see the motion of the earth, and in exactly the same way that we see the motion
of a ship that we are sailing on: we see that motion by seeing other things
moving relative to our "vehicle" (the ship or the earth).

"He (Ludwig Wittgenstein) once asked me: 'Why do people say it is more logical
to think that the sun turns around the Earth than Earth rotating around its own
axis?' I answered: 'I think because it seems as if the sun turns around the
Earth.' 'Good,' he said, 'but how would it have been if it had seemed as if the
Earth rotates around its own axis then?'"
-- Anscombe, 1959, p. 151
