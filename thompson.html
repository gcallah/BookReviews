            <p>
                The book under consideration here is intended as the first half
                of a study on the American founding: this volume focuses on the
                Declaration of Independence and the causes of the American
                Revolution, while the second volume is intended to focus on the 
                United States Constitution. Thompson feels that the bi-partite
                division of these works, as well as their complementarity,
                reflects a fundamental reality about the United States: as he
                puts it, "The relationship between the current and the proposed
                volume is virtually identical to the connection that Abraham
                Lincoln saw between the Declaration of Independence and the
                Constitution" (xi).
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson is certainly not one to hide his light under a bushel.
                In the Preface he tells us, "I have attempted to write a book
                that is original, comprehensive, and transformative" (xiii).
                Now, in my understanding of what an hitorical work should be
                aiming at, it would be to determine what actually happened in
                the past, and how what happened at some particular time
                followed from what happened at earlier times. Such a work may,
                in fact, <i>wind up</i> being "original, comprehensive, and
                transformative," but to set out with those goals in mind is, I
                suggest, a deformation of the character of historical research.
            </p>

            <p>
                To elaborate upon this point, consider Thompson's distress that
                the works of Bernard Bailyn and Gordon S. Wood from the late
                sixties remain the most influential books on understanding the
                Revolution: "Surely, though, it should not remain the case that
                the most influential books on the American Revolution were
                written in the 1960s" (xii). Ok, why not? Mathematicians never
                exhibit anxiety over the fact that the most influential
                understanding of the relationship of the sides of a right
                triangle was arrived at several thousand years ago. No, the
                Pythagorean Theorem is <i>correct</i>, and mathematicians
                accept that this is right (for Euclidean spaces)
                and build on that result. Perhaps it just happens to be the
                case that Bailyn and Wood "got things right" in the 1960s:
                well, so what? And if they did <i>not</i> get things right,
                then certainly <i>how long ago</i> they made their errors is
                irrelevant. In fact, Thompson's concern about how "old" these
                works are seems to fly in the face of his repeated assertions
                that the American founders were espousing "timeless" truths. If
                their truths from the 1700s are not to be dismissed as being
                "old," then why shoud the works of Bailyn and Woods suffer this
                fate?
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson suffers from a common tendency to create a false
                dichotomy: either someone ignores historical circumstances and
                accepts "timeless" values, or they are an unprincipled
                "relativist," thinking that there are no standards of right and
                wrong, only whatever some particular society happens to regard
                as right or wrong. That this dichotomy is false can be
                illustrated with a simple analogy: let's say I want to travel
                from Hawaii to Easter Island by the fastest route possible? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, if I lived in Hawaii in 1200 A.D., the fastes route would
                have been by catamaran. But today, a jet plane can surely get
                me there faster. Does that mean that "the truth" about the
                fastest route is relative? Of course not: catamaran <i>really
                was</i> the fastest route in 1200, and jet plane <i>really
                is</i> the fastest route today. In 1200, someone who suggested
                "walking" as the fastest route from Hawaii to Easter Island
                would have been objectively wrong, just as today someone
                recommending "catamaran" would be objectively wrong. And in the
                future, when we have constructed hyper-space tunnels, the
                answer "jet plane" will be objectively wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
                In fact, it is <i>only</i> by considering historical
                circumstances that we can really, objectively determine what
                would have been the best action <i>available to an actor</i> in
                the circumstances in which they found themselves. If we want to
                criticize the Polynesians for traveling for Easter Island by
                catamaran, the only coherent way to do so is by pointing out
                that, in their actual, historical circumstances, they in fact
                had a better alternative. It is ridiculous to argue, "These
                Polynesian explorers were fools: why didn't they just take a
                jet plane?" when there were no jet planes available to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson goes on to contend that he has developed "a new
                approach to history writing that I shall call new moral
                history" (6). This approach, he says, "emphasizes thinking,
                judging, choosing, and acting individuals over large-scale
                social processes moved by unforeseen forces" (6). But to anyone
                who has studied the historiographical work of, say, Dilthey,
                Collingwood, Oakeshott, or Mises, this approach will hardly
                seem new. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson's use of "causation."
            </p>

            <p>
                Thompson is a tremendous fan of John Locke, praising him as the
                "first philosopher to put morality on a secular basis" (p. ?).
            </p>

            <p>
                "Locke and those who follow him in his course go on to live and
                to participate in a civilizational environment that has been
                formed into the remotest wrinkles of its intellectual language
                by the very tradition they try to remove. Hence, the attempt to
                return to the earlier phase will result not in a genuine
                removal of tradition (which would imply the rebuilding of a
                civilization on a new basis) but in a far-reaching devastation
                of the intellectual form of contemporary civilization."
                https://voegelinview.com/lockes-reasonable-method/
            </p>

            <p>
            For Locke, "God has made men; they are his property and they are
            under a duty to keep themselves alive and not to damage each other
            because any action of this kind would mean damage to God’s
            property. God is a serious person. He does not make men for fun; if
            he makes them he wants them to last as long as possible... If we
            inquire into the source of the rule that nobody must damage God’s
            property we are referred to God, Nature, Reason, and Common Equity;
            none of these sources is defined or explained in any way
            whatsoever" (146).
            </p>

            <p>
            "The rule of doing no damage has nothing to do with reason, nature,
            or other hieroglyphs, but has for its source the ethical convention
            of lock and of the society of which he is the respected
            representative. Man is a proprietor who watches over his own
            property and recognizes his duty not to damage anybody else’s, and
            God is formed in his image... For... Locke, he is a manufacturer who
            does not want his property to be damaged" (147).
            </p>

            <p>
            "Whether God is a proprietor or not, what really matters is that
            man is a proprietor of himself. No pretext of derivation is made
            for the second step; man simply 'has a property in his own person'"
            (147).
            </p>


            <p>
                Thompson is enamored of Locke's idea of self ownership, paying no
                heed to the fact that it is nonsensical even with in the
                context of Locke's on philosophy. Locke suggests that one justly
                acquires ownership of some thing by mingling one’s own labor
                with it.￼ And he even makes a logical step of admitting that
                this renders God the owner of everyone.￼ Furthermore, for
                anyone who wishes to deny the existence of God, this would
                leave a person’s parents as a person’s rightful owner, since it
                was their "labor" they brought about that person.￼ So Locke’s
                leap to then declare that people somehow "own themselves" makes
                no sense at all. But what does that matter, when it gives
                Thompson a philosophical big-name to cite in defending
                individualism?
            </p>

            <p>
                The point here is not to argue that "timeless truths" do not exist.
                Instead, it is that Locke’s philosophy isn’t the right place to
                look for them, since his philosophy is not even internally
                consistent.
            </p>

            <p>
            "Ideals must not be confused with reality, particularly given the
            fact that Jefferson Inn is revolutionary colleagues expected their
            principles to be put into practice" (124-125).
            </p>

            <p>
            I could understand if Thompson had written that ideals must not be
            confused with reality, since the founders had no intention of
            putting their ideals practice. But the sentence as it stands is a
            little puzzling.
            </p>

            <p>
            "With the possible exception of the Quakers, few Americans (or
            anyone anywhere else for that matter) before the 1760s seriously
            questioned the moral status of slavery" (125).
            </p>

            <p>
            This is nonsense: there had been Catholic abolition movements since
            the 5th century, and a Papal bull condemning slavery had been
            issued just two decades before the 1760s. However, since these
            facts do not fit with Thompson's narrative that before the
            Enlightenment all was medieval darkness, they are conveniently
            ignored.
            </p>

            <p>
            "Day-to-day life for ordinary people in seventeenth- and
            eighteenth-century Anglo-American society could be described as, to
            quote Thomas Hobbes, 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'"
            (128).
            </p>

            <p>
            It is hard to imagine what the point of quoting Hobbes here is,
            since his famous phrase is a description of what he thought life
            would be like <i>outside</i> of society.
            </p>

            <p>
            Faced with reconciling the founders belief that all men are created
            equal with the fact that many of them owned slaves, Thompson writes
            that we must "examine the ideas, decisions, and actions of
            America's revolutionary generation on the founders' own terms"
            (128). But, this is precisely the "historicism" that Thompson
            roundly condemns in other parts of this very book! It seems
            historicism is good when it reaches conclusions Thompson likes, but
            bad when it doesn't.
            </p>

            <p>
            "Eighteenth-century Americans took for granted that all men
            everywhere have natural rights... The rights of nature are
            indefeasible, inherent, universal, eternal, and absolute" (164)
            </p>

            <p>
            They may have "taken this for granted" as an abstraction, but as
            soon as it came time to deal with concrete matters, the country was
            immediately riven by acrimonious disputes: federalists versus
            anti-federalists, the Whiskey Rebellion,
            Jefferson versus Hamilton, the Alien and Sedition Acts, 
            the Federalists versus the Democratic-Republicans, 
            New England versus Jefferson's tariffs, and so on. There was
            agreement on fine-sounding, vague ideas, and little agreement on
            what these meant in practice.
            </p>

            <p>
            “to have property in one’s rights is to say that each and every
            individual has sovereignty over his choices and conduct within the
            limits agreed to by all individuals in a particular society” (167)
            </p>

            <p>
            This is striking firstly because, just a few pages before, rights were
            "absolute," but now they only extend to the "limits" agreed to by
            "all individuals" in some society. And there is the second
            surprising item: no society has ever existed anywhere in which "all
            individuals" agreed to what those limits should be.
            </p>

            <p>
            Thompson quotes the Reverend Dan Foster as claiming “if anything in
            nature is capable of proof [The basic rights of nature] are capable
            to be proved, and of being set in a most convincing and clear point
            of light before all reasonable and impartial minds￼￼￼” (170).
            </p>

            <p>
            But numerous people have gone about trying to "prove" what such
            rights imply about a political system, and, unlike geometricians,
            they keep reaching different conclusions. The only way to defend
            Foster's conclusion is to declare that one can detect a "reasonable
            and impartial mind" based on whether a person arrives at the same
            theory of rights as oneself.
            </p>

            <p>
            As MacIntyre noted in <i>Whose Justice? Which Rationality?</i>,
           ￼ “the history of attempts to construct a
            morality for tradition-free individuals, whether by an appeal to
            one out of several conceptions of universalizability or to one out
            of equally￼ multifarious conceptions of utility or to shared
            intuitions or to some combination of these, has its outcome... been
            a history of continuously unresolved disputes￼” (334)
            </p>

            <p>
            When it comes to the ownership of private property, Thompson
            enthusiastically embraces Locke's proposal that one comes to own
            property by "mixing" one's labor with it. That the idea of "mixing"
            labor with objects is a very strange way of thinking has been noted
            before -- see Nozick (1974) or Waldron (1983). Waldron notes that
            the very idea of mixing labor with objects appears to be a category
            error: I can mix eggs and flour, since both are objects. But how
            can I mix labor, which is an action, with, say, wood, which is an
            object?
            </p>

            <p>
            And Nozick asks us to consider that,
            even if we grant that it makes sense to say one can "mix"
            labor with an object, it is not clear why this should give the
            mixer ownership of the object. If I take some jewelry I own, and I
            "mix" it with the ocean by tossing it in, almost everyone would
            think I had <i>thrown away</i> my jewelry, not that I had suddenly
            gained ownership of the ocean. Why should things be different with
            my labor?
            </p>

            <p>
            A simple way of trying to make sense of Locke is to posit that he
            really meant, "If you made it, you own it." But then why not say
            that? Well, what perhaps Locke most wants to justify is the
            ownership of <i>land</i>, the most important thing owned by most
            people when he wrote. And in particular, why do various Englishmen
            own vast tracts of land in Ireland and in North America, when there
            were people there before them who seemingly ought to be the just
            owners?
