            <p>
                Paul Feyerabend was one of the most fascinating figures in the
                20th-century philosophy of science. A student of Karl Popper, he
                he came to stridently reject his former teacher's "rationalistic"
                view of science, and (in)famously endorsed "methodological
                anarchy."
            </p>
 
            <p>
                The work under review here was not published during
                Feyerabend's lifetime. It is essentially the first volume of a
                projected three-volume work tracing the development of the
                philosophy of nature from paleolithic times, through the
                ancient Greeks, and up to recent developments in relativity and
                quantum mechanics. It presents a new face of the "gadfly"
                Feyerabend to the philosophical community, that of the serious
                scholar of the history of philosophical thought.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feyerabend's starting point, the neolithic understanding of
                nature, is important in that philosophers of science have
                seldom regarded the "primitive" knowledge of nature as anything more
                than ignorance and superstition (see Wootton, 2015, for an
                representative example). That is a view Feyerabend vigorously
                rejects. For instance, he writes:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "The assumption that humans of the Stone or Bronze Age would 
                have had only the most primitive knowledge of nature may be
                flattering to our progressivist self-image. But it has little
                plausibility since Stone Age humans were already fully
                developed members of the species <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and it is
                incompatible with recent research. The environmental and societal
                problems that the early <i>Homo sapiens</i> had to face were
                incomparably greater than the challenges facing our contemporary
                scientists. These problems has to be solved with the most
                primitive means, often without any division of labor or
                specialized skills, and the solutions arrived at indicate a
                level of intelligence and sensitivity that is clearly not inferior
                to ours." -- pp. 5-6
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                He insists that we take the neolithic view, which he sees as
                persisting up through the work of Homer, seriously: these
                people really did have the experiences the historical evidence
                indicates that they had:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "An animated world, divine intervention, 
                the 'openness' of the soul's life are
                not preconceptions or errors or 
                results of a superficial approach, but clearly
                recognizable components of this experience 
                of the world, and their elimination
                constitutes an elimination of important knowledge." -- p. 90
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                However, Feyerabend asserts, we see the signs of the breakdown
                of this understanding of the cosmos even in Homer, and the
                breakdown becomes more pronounced in Hesiod, and in the
                pre-Socratic philosophers. In a sense, the philosophers
                "rationalized" cosmology, but they did so only by excluding
                large parts of experience:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Thus, Anaximander's universe and its later modifications are
                uniform. <em>And yet they are not complete.</em> They do not contain
                mythological events, dreams or spawns of imagination... We push
                the events in question out of our physical world and into
                another world, which is conceived of either as a world
                consisting entirely of appearance, of non-reality, or as a very
                real yet non-physical world... In both cases we obtain an
                antiseptic real (physical) world at the expense of
                insurmountable problems: how can we reunify domains that are so
                radically separate? Increased specialization makes the problems
                disappear from the researchers' horizon, which only strengthens
                said researchers conviction that their professional ideology is
                indeed capable of successfully overcoming <em>all</em>
                difficulties." -- pp. 126-132.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Indeed, the purported "rationality" of the view emerging with
                the Greek philosophers does not stand up to empirical scrutiny:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "the disappearance of the gods... today... is generally regarded as
                'rational,' and the gradual elimination of divine traces as a
                further increase in rationality. Yet this means identifying
                rationalism with materialism -- a dubitable procedure based on a
                naive naturalistic interpretation of the material. It indicates an
                oversight of the possibility that materialism may 
                have <em>contradicted</em> the contemporary experience of 
                the world, and so it may be considered 'irrational' 
                in light of an empiricist methodology." --
                p. 105
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Feyerabend argues that, in the new philosophy of nature,
                abstractions come to be seen as more real than concrete
                reality:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Note the tendency here [in Parmenides] that is commonplace in
                contemporary science: the thinker, that is, in antiquity the
                philosopher, deals with things that do not occur in intuition and
                that have paradoxical qualities. <em>These</em> are the things that are
                'real' for the thinker... The rift was never entirely overcome;
                rather, the 'real world' became ever more remote from the world in
                which we live and feel. It becomes institutionalized until
                eventually the power of the growing institutions of science and an
                education regulated by them closes the rift from the other end by
                means of a kind of training that keeps transforming intuition, the
                behavior regulated by it, and thereby us humans as well until we
                obey the scientific forms of thought and see the world through
                them, as a junk room deserted by gods yet well organized." -- p. 153
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Feyerabend goes on to describe how this new attitude to nature,
                one that cleaves the world of experience into a "subjective"
                realm that includes dreams, myths, emotions, and even sense
                qualities, and an "objective" realm consisting only of what can
                measured and thus quantified, gradually hardened into a
                "fundamentalist" epistemology disconnected from the actual
                practice of science:
            </p>


            <blockquote>
                "The second characteristic trait of the modern way of studying
                nature is the absence of a foundation. Though there is a lot of
                talk about the new and fertile foundation that Descartes, Galileo,
                and Newton introduced and used in their research, such a foundation
                cannot be found in practice... Unlike Aristotelian philosophy,
                which requires, identifies, and uses a foundation in actual
                research, we now have a fundamentalist epistemology and entirely
                separate practice of research in philosophy of nature and science.
                This antagonist and the related irrationality of modern science is
                hidden by a slanted method of representation, which depicts even
                the most revolutionary discovery as resting on a solid foundation."
                -- pp. 173-174
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                A common myth about the Scientific Revolution is that it
                represented a turn from ungrounded speculation to theory based
                solidly upon facts. However, as Feyerabend notes, Galileo
                criticized Aristotle for relying too much upon the experience, and
                paying insufficient attention to speculative reason! He quotes
                Galileo (from On Motion):
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "[Aristotle] asserted [his theory of motion] on the basis of no
                other reason than to experience... But, to employ reasoning at all
                times rather than examples (for what we seek are the clauses of
                effects, and these causes are not given to us by experience)..." --
                p. 182
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Feyerabend's research presented in this volume provides us with
                a fascinating insight into the serious historical contemplation
                that lay behind his "anarchic" methodological stance. One need
                not accept all of Feyerabend's conclusion to appreciate that he
                was correct in noting that, despite all of the scientific wonders
                the new view of nature has brought us, important aspects of
                human experience were marginalized in the course of its rise to
                dominance.
