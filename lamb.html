            Peter Lamb. <i>Socialism</i>.
         	Cambridge, England and
            Medford, Massachusetts: Polity Press, 2019.

        <p>
            Peter Lamb’s book <i>Socialism</i> is part of a “Key Concepts in
            Political Theory“ series, including works on such topics as
            patriotism, fascism, authority, libertarianism, and citizenship.
            The series is clearly intended to provide introductory guides to
            important topics in political theory.  This setting is important in
            judging the merit of this work, since the most
            crucial question about a member of such a series is, "Does this
            particular contribution fulfill its role in the
            series as a whole?" In the case under consideration, the answer
            will turn out to be, "In one respect, very well, but in another,
            rather poorly." So let us see how that can be so.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamb's remit is to somehow provide the reader with an adequate
            overview of "socialism" in a quite slim volume, and, no doubt,
            the extreme space restraints under which he worked are somewhat
            responsible for the lacunae I will note below. In any case,
            Lamb begins by describing the diversity of "socialist" thought, but
            proceeds to argue that nevertheless "socialism... remains a
            coherent ideology" (1), its diverse strands united by a commitment
            to "equality, freedom, and community" (1).
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamb categorizes socialist thought as falling into three main
            camps: revolutionary socialism, exemplified by Marx, Trotsky,
            Lenin, and Mao; guild socialism with the main exemplar being G.D.H.
            Cole; and democratic socialism, represented by the British Fabians,
            such as George Bernard Shaw and the Webbs, and later C.A.R.
            Crossland. Lamb offers both clear explanations of the differences
            between these approaches, as well as excellent reasons to regard
            them all as properly categorized under the umbrella term of
            socialism. Lamb's knowledge of socialist literature, both
            theoretical and empirical, as well as the history of actual
            socialist regimes, is comprehensive and put to excellent use.
        </p>

            So far, so good. But surely an introductory work like this ought
            to deal with the critics of the idea it addresses, as well as its
            advocates. After all, it is in responding to critics that an idea
            really proves its mettle. And it is here that Lamb's book 
            disappoints, as there is very, very little space devoted to
            critiques of socialism.  Lamb, for instance, notes Sarkar’s claim
            that “many people in capitalist developing countries could only
            dream of the economic living standards of the German democratic
            republic” (5). True, a critic may reply, but the East German
            workers were enjoying a standard of living that had declined from
            Germany’s capitalist past, while those in developing countries were
            experiencing rising standards of living as their nations had become
            more capitalist.  The critics claim may or may not be true: the
            point I wish to make here is that Lamb does not even
            consider such a view.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamb discusses "Julius Nyerere's African socialist project" (42)
            in Tanzania. He admits that after a dozen years of socialist rule,
            the country saw "continuing poverty, inequality, malnutrition, and
            lack of education" (43). But he does not examine what happened
            <i>after</i> Tanzania abandoned socialism, which is described in an
            IMF paper as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            "In 1985, Tanzania was in severe economic distress, plagued by
            widespread shortages and high inflation. Agricultural production,
            the mainstay of the economy, had been declining steadily...
            Exports of cash crops... had fallen by half between 1970
            and 1985. A foreign exchange shortage led to a precipitous drop in
            imports, which in turn caused a crisis in the manufacturing
            sector...
        </p>

        <p>
            "Twenty years later, Tanzania looks radically different. Inflation
            has declined to single digits... Economic growth is
            buoyant, averaging 7 percent a year since 2000. Real per capita
            income has risen by 50 percent..."
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, the above is from the IMF, and perhaps it is all just
            capitalist propaganda. Nevertheless, there are similar reports from
            many countries around the world, and it would have been salutary
            for Lamb to have addressed the argument running, "Sure, you
            socialists <i>claim</i> to want to help the poor, but, <i>in
            fact</i>, your preferred policies leave them poor, while
            market-friendly policies <i>actually</i> increase their standard of
            living." This argument might be incorrect, but certainly it is at
            least worthy of refutation in a book such as this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamb, naturally enough, is anxious to disassociate the socialism he
            likes from National Socialism, or Nazism. And so he writes,
            “Nazism did not bring about anything like the combination of
            freedom and equality that lies at the core of socialism” (45). 
            But neither, of course, have any of the regimes that Lamb does not
            think of as socialist “masquerades.” In fact, one of the most
            famous critiques of socialism, Hayek's <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>,
            makes the case that socialism is <i>inherently</i> incapable of
            bringing about the combination of freedom and equality to which
            socialists aspire.  Again, it may be the case that Hayek is full of
            it and socialists can readily achieve their aims. Nevertheless, it
            is surprising that a book aiming to serve as a scholarly
            introduction to socialism barely mentions Hayek. Nor do we find
            Ludwig von Mises in the references (the book lacks an index),
            despite the fact that socialist Oskar Lange wrote, in his paper "On
            the Economic Theory of Socialism":
        </p>

        <p>
            "Socialists have certainly good reason to be grateful to Professor
            Mises... For it was his powerful challenge that forced the
            socialists to recognize the importance of an adequate system of
            economic accounting to guide the allocation of resources in a
            socialist economy... a statue of Professor Mises ought to occupy an
            honorable place in the great hall of the Ministry of Socialization
            or of the Central Planning Board of the socialist state." (1936)
        </p>

        <p>
            But the biggest surprise of all was Lamb's apparently complete
            rejection of one of Marx's key ideas.
            Discussing Stalin, Lamb claims "Stalin ignored the human-made
            nature of economic laws, which thus cannot be objective" (59).
            Here, this reviewer must reluctantly side with Stalin. Marx
            himself, who was a quite competent student of Smith, Ricardo, and
            other classical economists, would no doubt turn over in his grave
            upon seeing Lamb's claim. After all, if "economic laws" are just
            "human-made," then what becomes of Marx's claim that economic
            systems must, of necessity, proceed from primitive communism,
            through slave-based societies, to feudalism, to capitalism, 
            to socialism, and then to mature communism?
            If this progression is "human-made," rather than
            objective, then perhaps feudalism could be what's coming next? Marx
            himself, in <i>Capital</i>, sought "to lay bare the economic
            law of motion of modern society" (Marx, 1867). But if this "law" was
            something merely made up by Marx, what in the world would have been
            the point of trying "to lay [it] bare"? Indeed, in the very same
            introduction, Marx goes much further, and states that his system
            "is a question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies
            working with iron necessity towards inevitable results" (Marx,
            1867). Now, it is certainly possible that Marx was completely wrong
            about the "iron necessity" of economic laws, and that Lamb is
            correct in asserting that we humans simply make them up as we wish
            them to be. But if that is true, then Lamb ought to be honest and
            admit that <i>his</i> sort of socialism stands in stark
            contradiction to Marx's socialism, with it axiomatic dependency on
            the "inevitable results" of economic laws. Instead, Lamb repeatedly
            invokes the authority of Marx, while seemingly rejecting the most
            fundamental aspect of Marx's system.

            Given the attraction of the socialist ideals of equality, freedom,
            and community, then why are there so few socialist regimes around?
            In his conclusion, Lamb claims that "Capitalist hegemony suppressed
            opposition by making alternatives appear unrealistic and
            undesirable" (116).  While no doubt this is something capitalists
            and advocates for capitalism attempt to do, Lamb ought to admit
            that socialists, when they have actually gained power in
            some country, have done a pretty good job themselves of making
            their alternative "appear unrealistic and undesirable."
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary, Lamb's book is an excellent primer on what socialists
            think about socialism. While I think it would’ve been a much better
            book if it also told us what non-socialists think about
            socialism, half the story well told is better than the whole story
            poorly told: one can always seek elsewhere for the rest of
            the story, at least if one knows it is missing.
