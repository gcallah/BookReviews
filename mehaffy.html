                "The city itself would become a kind of machine for serving up
                whatever we needed or wanted" (p. 20).

                "Formal gover<i>ment</i>, in [Elinor Ostrom's] view, needs to
                be supplanted with many other forms of gover<i>nance</i>,
                formal and informal, across many scales" (22). (The recent work of
                Nassim Taleb has emphasized the importance of scale to 
                sound governance as well.)

            <p>
                "Most people are now at least generally familiar with 'systems
                theory,' and with fractals, algorithms, strange attractors,
                network science, and the like" (35). This is a strange passage.
                For instance, what are "algorithms" doing in there? "People"
                have been familiar with algorithms for over two thousand years:
                we still teach "Euclid's algorithm" and the "sieve of
                Eratosthenes" to computer science students today. One of the
                founders of the "old sciences," Isaac Newton himself,
                devised an algorithm for finding numeric roots. The existence
                of these and many other algorithms hardly stopped the terrible
                surgery done on cities in the mid-20th century... so why are
                they relevant in this list? Even some of the other items,
                such as fractals and strange attractors,
                while only recognized more recently, still appear more like
                trendy terms thrown in to make the practical knowledge of
                how to build livable cities more "scientific." People around
                the world, using traditional wisdom, built aesthetic and 
                life-encouraging cities for centuries before they had ever
                heard of "fractals" or "strange attractors": one can help but
                wondering if Mehaffy is still in thrall to scientism, albeit 
                a more hip version than "old-fashioned" Newtonian science.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, it is true that the increasing recognition,
                in scientific circles, of what Jane Jacobs called
                "complex orders" (in contrast to simple orders, dealt
                with by classical mechanics, and randomness, dealt with
                by statistical mechanics), <i>can</i> represent
                a step forward. But if it does, it is through warning
                scientists, and, more importantly, adherents of scientism,
                that these complex orders are <i>not</i> susceptible to
                theoretical mastery, but instead can only be (partially)
                tamed through experiential knowledge.  They will be represented
                by commonsense heuristics, and not theoretical propositions. As
                Eric Voegelin noted, "every attempt to construe the commonsense
                insights which refer to the order of the entire existence, as
                scientific "" propositions  according to the model of the
                natural sciences,  and find beyond them  "principles" that
                could take the place the real source of the order, is a
                violation against the structure of the realm of man"
                (Anamnesis, 211).
            </p>

            <p>
                We must now, unfortunately, turn our attention to the
                grimmest part of this work: Mehaffy's excursion into 
                philosophy. Here he "butts heads" with both Plato
                and Aristotle, producing a spectacle much like watching
                a butterfly "battering" a pair of elephants. It is doubtful
                whether Mehaffy has even read either thinker; although they 
                both have a single book appearing in the bibliography,
                neither book is actually cited in the text.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mehaffy is contemptuous of Plato's work describing the "forms."
                Of course, as Collingwood noted, Greek thought had reached an
                impasse trying to sensibly connect the transcendent and the
                immanent, and it was only with the formulation of the idea
                of the trinity that the impasse was broken. Nevertheless,
                Plato <i>was</i> a great thinker, and deserves to met with
                arguments a little bit better than: "Going back to Plato, was
                the shape of a dorsal fin a timeless form, existing in some
                unseen realm? No, certainly not: it was a pattern that formed
                for comprehensible reasons..." (118).
            </p>

            <p>
                So, Mehaffy's "refutation" of Plato is... "no, certainly not"?
                Why the sneering at the notion of "some unseen realm"? Is he
                not aware that much of modern science has consisted in the
                revelation of one unseen realm after another? And does he
                really think that Plato thought the forms were
                incomprehensible?
            </p>

            <p>
                Mehaffy continues, "So we can finally dispense with an
                external, transcendent realm of <i>Forms</i>,
                and shift our understanding to that patterns" (119).
                Why "finally"? Has Western Civilization been sick of these
                "<i>Forms</i>" for centuries, but just could not figure out how
                to rid itself of them, until Mehaffy came along? And
                apparently, all it took to rid ourselves of these louse-like 
                forms was "of course not"! If we had only known! But, in any
                case, thank goodness for Mehaffy, we can now jettison
                these annoying forms and replace them with... patterns.
                But consider that in <i>The Republic</i> Plato writes,
                "But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the
                likenesses of real existences modelled after their patterns..."
                In other words, for Plato, "forms" and "patterns" are
                synonyms... so Mehaffy has triumphantly replaced one of Plato's
                terms for transcendent existents with another of Plato's
                terms for them.
            </p>

            <p>
                But surely there must be more here than that? Since Mehaffy
                wants to boot transcendence out of respectable society, then
                where do these "patterns" have a home? His answer is that,
                "As far as we are concerned, ultimately these are 'only'
                abstractions within own our own brains" (119).
                Well, well... but how can an "abstraction," something
                distinctly non-material, exist in a concrete, flesh-and-blood
                brain? And if they only "exist in our brains," then of what use
                are they in explaining, say, dorsal fins? Don't worry, Mehaffy
                assures us, these patterns "are no less 'real' structures
                in the world" (119).
                If, "as far as we are concerned," these
                patterns "only" exist in our own brains, then for whom,
                exactly, are they "real structures in the world"?
                For Martians, for angels, for God?
                I'm sorry, but this is simply
                pseudo-philosophical double-talk, designed to impress the
                philosophically naive.
                The entire two chapters of "philosophy"
                should have simply been left out of this book, as the
                resulting tome would have been less dense in both senses 
                of the word.
            </p>

            <p>
                After a salutary review of the large environmental cost of
                the deliberately planned, "strip-mall and tract housing"
                suburban development that dominated post-WWII America, Mehaffy
                claims we need a new "operating system of growth" (152)
                I.e., he wants to repair the problems produced by top-down
                attempts to engineer society with a new, better attempt to
                top-down engineer society.
            </p>

            <p>
                "the primary aim of architectural design today is, very simply,
                not to find the best possible solution for human environments,
                but rather, to create adventurous new sculptural works of art
                on a gigantic scale" p. 167
            </p>

            <p>
                Mehaffy has done his readers a great service in showing
                the harmony in the ideas of Jacobs and Alexander, and has
                many salutary suggestions on urban design. It is unfortunate
                that he was unable to resist entering philosophical
                discussions that are evidently over his head, but the ugly
                episode of that excursion does not render this book unworthy
                of an urbanist's attention. Just, for your own well being,
                skip over those chapters.
