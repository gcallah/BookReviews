Neither Jesus nor Buddha "put together a coherent argument." And often neither did Plato! (Gadamer)


Newtonian physics did not *discover* that an object in motion tends to stay in motion: it presupposed this.

As an Oakeshottian, I understand every "special science" makes presuppositions: so no objection to Darwin's!
