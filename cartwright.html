                Cartwright casually mentions the idea that singular
                causation is actually the fundament, but dismisses it
                in favor of a "general to specific" (19) approach.
                <br />
                Cartwright defends the notion of causation in singular cases
                against those who contend that only a statistical study on a
                large sample can produce robust evidence of causation. She
                holds that we can detect single causes much as we detect causes
                in a large study, as exhibitions of law-like regularities.

                Bueno and Neiman contend that evidence does not and should not
                depend on the beliefs of the person evaluating the evidence.
                One would have thought that Michael Polanyi's work would have
                put an end to such silliness long ago: evidence is always
                evidence <i>to</i> someone, and whether it counts as evidence
                will depend upon their beliefs.

            Frigg and Nguyen tackle the issue of how scientific models
            "represent" the phenomenon they are said to be modeling. Their
            ingenious answer is that a scientific model points to a class of
            events by declaration ("this is a model of the economy") but that
            it is successful as a scientific model to the extent it exemplifies
            and draws our attention to particular aspects of the thing modeled.
            Thus, our model of the economy built from
            pipes and water is a <i>good</i>
            model if, say, the flow of cash through the real economy is
            exemplified by the flow of water through the pipes.
            They do make the curious assertion that things like pictures
            of griffins or maps of Middle Earth do not represent anything:
            surely these are visible representation of things human beings have
            imagined!
