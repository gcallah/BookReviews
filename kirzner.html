            <p>
                Israel M. Kirzner is the dean of the "Austrian school" of
                economics. (I use scare quotes only because some, even some
                called "Austrian," dispute there is such a school, often
                contending that it has been absorbed into the mainstream.) Over
                six decades he has produced a stream of papers and books
                defending and extending the insights into the market as a
                process achieved by his mentors Ludwig von Mises and F.A.
                Hayek. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The book under review is part of a 10-volume series collecting
                Kirznerâ€™s works. This volume in particular contains a series of
                essays centered around the theme of entrepreneurship, and
                expanding out from there to include such other topics as
                competition, economic planning, information versus knowledge,
                and advertising. These secondary themes are connected to
                entrepreneurship through Kirzner's understanding of the latter
                as consisting of alertness to hitherto hidden profit
                opportunities. The constantly changing "data" of the market
                again and again render current economic circumstances
                sub-optimal, offering ever new arbitrage opportunities for
                entrepreneurs to exploit. It is this view of the market
                that leads Kirzner to focus on the <i>process</i> by which these
                sub-optimal conditions are (partially) corrected, rather than
                on a mathematical description of the state of affairs which
                would hold if there were no such errors to correct.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kirzner contrasts his ("Austrian") process-centered
                understanding of the market with the mainstream focus on
                analyzing equilibrium states, in which entrepreneurial activity
                has ceased, because it has no work left to do. Such
                hypothetical states, Kirzner contends, are both of little
                importance for real world markets, and offer no explanation of
                how such an equilibrium might be achieved. Kirzner focuses his
                attention on one particular equilibrium model, that of perfect
                competition. In the essay "The Driving Force of the Market,"
                he writes:
            </p>

            <p>
				"The model cannot be used to 'explain' market prices; the model
                presumes that everyone has, somehow, correctly and
                self-fulfilling guessed what the market price is going to be.
                The circumstance that (quite apart from the assumed correctness
                of the anticipated price) the model treats each market
                participant as a price-taker further underscores the
                uselessness of the model as an explanation for the manner in
                which prices are adjusted. No one in the model ever does change
                his price bids or offers." -- p. 52
            </p>

            <p>
            In "Knowledge Problems and Their Solutions," Kirzner makes the
            distinction between two types of knowledge problems, which I will
            refer to as type A and type B.
            Type A problems involve undue optimism, and are self-correcting: if
            I think I can sell my computer programming services for $1 million
            per hour, I surely will be disappointed, and, if wise, I will lower
            my price.  My very attempt to act on my over-optimistic beliefs
            reveals their falsity.
            </p>

            <p>
            Type B problems, on the other hand, involve undue pessimism, and,
            per Kirzner, are not self-correcting. I may believe that my current
            boss, who is paying me $50 per hour, is the best employer I can
            find. But, unbeknownst to me, just down the block is someone who
            would happily pay me $100 per hour, if he knew of my existence. And
            I would happily go work for him, if I knew of his. For type B
            problems to be "corrected" requires entrepreneurial action,
            perhaps, say, a job placement firm that will alert both the
            potential new employer and me to each other's presence in the
            market, for a fee.
            </p>

            <p>
            The broader theme under discussion in this essay is to what extent
            Hayek's move from confidence in the error-correcting properties of
            markets to the error-correcting properties of "social evolution" is
            justified. Kirzner argues that Hayek is on solid ground in
            believing that spontaneous social processes will correct type A
            errors, but on much shakier ground if he wishes to contend that
            such social processes can correct type B errors. And the reason for
            this, Kirzner contends, is that the correction of type B errors in
            the market depend upon the lure of entrepreneurial profit, while no
            similar attractant exists in non-market social contexts.
            </p>

            <p>
            Hayek cites the evolution of law, language, and money as examples
            of spontaneous social processes: let us grant, for the moment, that
            he is correct about this, something Kirzner is willing to do. But,
            Kirzner contends, such processes exhibit that social agents can
            spontaneously correct type A problems in non-market settings, and,
            at the best, that their self-interested actions might accidentally
            correct a type B problem. (And Kirzner notes the many cases in
            which spontaneous social processes might create an ever-worsening
            situation, such as those highlighted in the work of Thomas
            Schelling.) He offers an analysis of the Mengerian story of the
            evolution of a medium of exchange as an example: the
            entrepreneurial alertness to trade for a more liquid commodity,
            even if it is not the one ultimately wants to consume, "is never
            alertness to prospects of further increasing that liquidity... No
            entrepreneur could, by himself, discover opportunities for pure
            profit by attempting to move the barter society towards the use of
            money" (p. 102). But... why couldn't she? Whether or not any such
            thing ever actually happened, isn't it conceivable that some
            entrepreneur saw, say, silver being traded more-and-more, and so
            decided to become a market-maker in silver, in order to facilitate
            further increases in the liquidity of silver, to his own profit?
            </p>

            <p>
                But certainly Kirzner is correct in stating that there is "no
                basis for any extension of the welfare theorems relating to
                markets to the broader field of the theory of institutional
                evolution. The explanation for such benign tendencies, if
                indeed they exist, must be sought elsewhere" (p. 103).
            </p>

            <p>
            However, I wonder if Type B problems are really as little susceptible to
            self-correction as Kirzner contends. Consider the example of
            putting one's house on the market for too low a price: such an
            error is, I suggest, largley self-correcting: if I put my house on
            the market for (significantly) too low a price, on the date of the
            first open house showing, I will be flooded with potential buyers,
            and it will be obvious to me that I have been overly pessimistic
            about the price the house can fetch. Similarly, if I own a grocery,
            and I ask too low a price for my milk, I will run out of milk very
            fast, and it ought to be obvious to me that I could charge more for
            my milk.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the converse case, if I pessimistically believe that I must bid
            too much for a resource -- for instance, if I have started up a new
            tech company, and believe I must bid at least $300,000 to attract
            decent software engineers -- I may be quickly informed of my
            mistake because I am absolutely overwhelmed with software engineers
            applying for my open positions.
            </p>

            <p>
            So it seems to me that Kirzner's analysis of undue pessimism is not
            universal, but applies only to the cases where there are relatively
            few buyers or sellers of a commodity, so that an unduly low bid or
            ask price is not immediately revealed by a flood of sellers or
            buyers.
            </p>

            <p>
            But does this analysis perhaps not also undermine Kirzner's
            analysis of undue optimism? For if there are very few buyers or
            sellers in a market, could it not be the case that my asking price
            for, say, my house, is perfectly fine, and that the fact I have not
            sold it is simply the result of my not having waited long enough
            for the buyer, for whom mine is the perfect property, to come
            along?
            </p>

            <p>
                In his essay "Knowing about Knowledge," Kirzner contends:
            </p>

            <p>
                "Since individuals obviously differ in their entrepreneurial
                alertness, it is clear that opportunities for social
                improvement will tend to be exploited most fruitfully if
                institutional arrangements can be patterned so as to translate
                such opportunities into opportunities that will be encountered
                by those whose entrepreneurial alertness is the most acute, the
                most sensitive, and the most accurate." (p. 216)
            </p>

            <p>
                But what entrepreneurial alertness is alert <i>to</i>, per
                Kirzner, is <i>profit</i> opportunities, not "opportunities for
                social improvement." Now, one could protest that those
                opportunities are the same thing, but then what about an
                entrepreneur who is alert to the fact that the Internet offers
                a "better" way to deliver rape-fantasy videos to those who are
                titillated by the idea of raping women, or alert to the
                possibility of creating a new, far more addictive form of
                opiate that will yield huge profits to its creator? A hedonist
                utilitarian <i>might</i> be able to make a case that these are
                "social improvements": if these innovations are desired by
                those who consume them, then all is well! However, Kirzner is
                not a utilitarian hedonist, and it seems unlikely
                that he would really see them as such. But if he would not,
                then what happens to his case for maximally releasing
                entrepreneurial alertness, given that profit opportunities are
                <i>not</i> equal to opportunities for social improvement?
            </p>

            <p>
                In "Advertising in an Open-Ended Universe," Kirzner offers
                important insights on the difference between economic analysis
                of a "closed universe" and of an "open-ended universe." In the
                closed universe, there are only what Donald Rumsfeld would call
                "known unknowns": an economic agent may be lacking some
                information, but he <i>knows</i> that he lacks it, and does not
                act to acquire it only because the "search costs" of doing so
                are too high. But in Kirzner's "open-ended" universe, there are
                also "unknown unknowns": not only do economic agents not know
                everything possibly relevant to their choices, but they also
                often have no idea of what they do not know. In such a
                universe, "to choose... is to strike out boldly into a largely
                unseen world. To act as a producer... is not to fabricate a
                commodity for a perceived market; it is to create a commodity
                for a market the extent of which must be imagined... [and in]
                which any number of competing producers may be introducing
                novel products at prices that can only be guessed at" (p. 249).
                The "open-ended" universe is surely a more accurate description
                of the actual choice situation of economic agents than is the
                closed one, whether one fully buys into the defense of
                advertising Kirzner draws from the distinction or not.
            </p>

            <p>
                Israel Kirzner is sometimes dismissed as a mere "market
                ideologue," placed in the same category as someone like Murray
                Rothbard. But these essays demonstrate that Kirzner's work
                contains penetrating insights as to the nature of economic
                reality, insights that have something to teach even those who
                do not share his sunny optimism about the outcomes likely to be
                yielded by a laissez-faire economic policy.
