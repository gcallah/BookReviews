            <p>
                Paul Feyerabend was one of the most fascinating figures in the
                20th-century philosophy of science. A student of Karl Popper, he
                he came to stridently reject his former teacher's "rationalistic"
                view of science, and (in)famously endorsed "methodological
                anarchy."
            </p>
 
            <p>
                The work under review here was not published during
                Feyerabend's lifetime. It is essentially the first volume of a
                projected three-volume work tracing the development of the
                philosophy of nature from paleolithic times, through the
                ancient Greeks, and up to recent developments in relativity and
                quantum mechanics. It presents a new face of the "gadfly"
                Feyerabend to the philosophical community, that of the serious
                scholar of the history of philosophical thought.

            <p>
                Feyerabend's starting point, the neolithic understanding of
                nature, is important in that philosophers of science have
                seldom regarded the "primitive" knowledge of nature as more
                than ignorance and superstition (see Wootton, 2015, for an
                representative example). That is a view Feyerabend vigorously
                rejects.

            <blockquote>
                "The assumption that humans of the Stone or Bronze Age would 
                have had only the most primitive knowledge of nature may be
                flattering to our progressivist self-image. But it has little
                plausibility since Stone Age humans were already fully
                developed members of the species <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and it is
                incompatible with recent research. The environmental and societal
                problems that the early <i>Homo sapiens</i> had to face were
                incomparably greater than the challenges facing our contemporary
                scientists. These problems has to be solved with the most
                primitive means, often without any division of labor or
                specialized skills, and the solutions arrived at indicate a
                level of intelligence and sensitivity that is clearly not inferior
                to ours." -- pp. 5-6

                "An animated world, divine intervention, 
                the 'openness' of the soul's life are
                not preconceptions or errors or 
                results of a superficial approach, but clearly
                recognizable components of this experience 
                of the world, and their elimination
                constitutes an elimination of important knowledge." -- p. 90

                "Thus, Anaximander's universe and its later modifications are
                uniform. <em>And yet they are not complete.</em> They do not contain
                mythological events, dreams or spawns of imagination... We push
                the events in question out of our physical world and into
                another world, which is conceived of either as a world
                consisting entirely of appearance, of non-reality, or as a very
                real yet non-physical world… In both cases we obtain an
                antiseptic real (physical) world at the expense of
                insurmountable problems: how can we reunify domains that are so
                radically separate? Increased specialization makes the problems
                disappear from the researchers' horizon, which only strengthens
                said researchers conviction that their professional ideology is
                indeed capable of successfully overcoming <em>all</em>
                difficulties." -- pp. 126-132.

            "the disappearance of the gods… today... is generally regarded as
            'rational,' and the gradual elimination of divine traces as a
            further increase in rationality. Yet this means identifying
            rationalism with materialism -- a dubitable procedure based on a
            naïve naturalistic interpretation of the material. It indicates an
            oversight of the possibility that materialism may 
            have <em>contradicted</em>
            the contemporary experience of the world, and so it may be
            considered 'irrational' in light of an empiricist methodology." --

            "Note the tendency here [in Parmenides] that is commonplace in
            contemporary science: the thinker, that is, in antiquity the
            philosopher, deals with things that do not occur in intuition and
            that have paradoxical qualities. <em>These</em> are the things that are
            "real" for the thinker... The rift was never entirely overcome;
            rather, the "real world" became ever more remote from the world in
            which we live and feel. It becomes institutionalized until
            eventually the power of the growing institutions of science and an
            education regulated by them closes the rift from the other end by
            means of a kind of training that keeps transforming intuition, the
            behavior regulated by it, and thereby us humans as well until we
            obey the scientific forms of thought and see the world through
            them, as a junk room deserted by gods yet well organized." -- p. 153

            "The second characteristic trait of the modern way of studying
            nature is the absence of a foundation. Though there is a lot of
            talk about the new and fertile foundation that Descartes, Galileo,
            and Newton introduced and used in their research, such a foundation
            cannot be found in practice... Unlike Aristotelian philosophy,
            which requires, identifies, and uses a foundation in actual
            research, we now have a fundamentalist epistemology and entirely
            separate practice of research in philosophy of nature and science.
            This antagonist and the related irrationality of modern science is
            hidden by a slanted method of representation, which depicts even
            the most revolutionary discovery as resting on a solid foundation."
            -- pp. 173-174

            <p>
            The common myth about the Scientific Revolution is that it
            represented a turn from ungrounded speculation to theory based
            solidly upon facts. However, as Feyerabend notes, Galileo
            criticized Aristotle for relying too much upon the experience, and
            paying insufficient attention to speculative reason! He quotes
            Galileo (from On Motion):

            "[Aristotle] asserted [his theory of motion] on the basis of no
            other reason than to experience... But, to employ reasoning at all
            times rather than examples (for what we seek are the clauses of
            effects, and these causes are not given to us by experience)..." --
