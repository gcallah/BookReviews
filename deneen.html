                <i>
                    Why Liberalism Failed
                </i>
                Patrick Deneen,
                Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2018.
            </h3>

            <p>
                American conservatives may be cheered by the appearance of a
                book entitled "Why Liberalism Failed." But be forewarned: in
                the sense in which Deneen is using
                "liberalism," most American
                conservatives are actually liberals. Deneen's use is
                the one common among political theorists, for 
                whom America does not have a conservative and
                liberal party, but a right-liberal party, focused
                on free markets and free trade, and a left-liberal
                party, focused on social issues. The United States, per
                this view, has never had a conservative party such
                as many European countries have had.
            </p>

            <p>
                A second point that may puzzle people first
                encountering the book is the implicit claim
                of the title: Deneed did not name the book,
                "Has Liberalism Failed?" or "Will Liberalism 
                Fail?", but "Why Liberalism Failed?" 
            </p>

            <p>
            "In contrast to its crueler competitor
            ideologies, liberalism is
            more insidious: as an ideology, it pretends
            to neutrality, claiming
            no preference and denying any intention of
            shaping the souls under
            its rule. It ingratiates by invitation
            to the easy liberties, diversions, and
            attractions of freedom, pleasure, and wealth."
            p. 5
            </p>

            <p>
            "The the insistent demand that we choose
            between protection of
            individual liberty and expansion
            of state activity masks the true
            relation between the state and market:
            that they grow constantly and necessarily together...
            Modern liberalism proceeds by making us
            both more individualist and more statist."
            p. 17
            </p>

            <p>
            "Liberalism has drawn down on a preliberal
            inheritance and resources that at
            once sustained liberalism but which
            he cannot replenish" (29-30).
            </p>

            <p>
            It is no sort of comeback to Deneen's view to
            point to the great material wealth
            produced by liberalism, since Patrick is quite
            aware of this wealth himself,
            and repeatedly acknowledges its existence.
            But in his view (and mine too)
            liberalism is analogous to the guy at the
            gym that has been popping steroids
            like mad for 10 years, who, when it is
            pointed out that he is getting himself
            into deep trouble, replies, "What?!
            Don't you see all the weight I can lift?"
            Why, yes we do, and it is the very thing
            that has raised your bench press
            poundage into the stratosphere that
            has gotten you into this fix.
            </p>

            <p>
            This is not to say we might not be wrong,
            just that it is foolish to point to
            the very thing we think has gotten liberal
            societies into such deep trouble
            (the all-out focus on the material) as
            a knockdown riposte to our critique.
            </p>

            <p>
            "[For Hobbes] the state is charged with maintaining
            social stability and preventing a return to
            natural anarchy... Human beings are thus, by nature,
            nonrelational creatures, separate and autonomous."
            32
            </p>

            <p>
            Proto-liberals like Locke and Jefferson and
            modern liberals like Mises and Rawls all start
            from a similar place: we are first and foremost human atoms,
            who only need enter into social groups in
            so far as it suits our interest to do
            so. Our original state was as free individuals,
            who "contracted" into social groups because we saw
            it was to our advantage. As Deneen notes, "Even marriage,
            Locke holds, is finally to be understood as
            a contract whose conditions are
            temporary and subject to revision..." (33).
            </p>

            <p>
            Or, as Mises put it:
            </p>

            <p>
            "The fundamental social phenomenon is the
            division of labor and its counterpart human cooperation. 
            </p>

            <p>
            "Experience teaches man that cooperative action is
            more efficient and
            productive than isolated action of
            self-sufficient individuals. The natural
            conditions determining man's life
            and effort are such that the division of
            labor increases output per unit of labor expended."
            -- Human Action
            </p>

            <p>
            "The fundamental facts that brought about
            cooperation, society, and
            civilization and transformed the animal man
            into a human being are the facts
            that work performed under the division of
            labor is more productive than
            isolated work and that man's reason is
            capable of recognizing this truth." --
            Human Action
            </p>

            <p>
            "Every living being is naturally the
            implacable enemy of every other living
            being, especially of all other members
            of his own species. For the means of
            subsistence are scarce. They do not permit
            all specimens to survive and to
            consummate their existence up to the point
            at which their inborn vitality is
            fully spent. This irreconcilable conflict
            of essential interests prevails first
            of all among the members of the same species..."
            -- Human Action
            </p>

            <p>
            So, per Mises, humans live in social
            groups only because they tried both the
            "isolated action of self-sufficient individuals"
            and social cooperation, and
            found the latter suited their self-interest
            better. Now, those of a religious
            bent should surely object to the idea
            that human beings care for each other
            only to the extent that they calculate
            that cooperating serves their own
            self-interest better than being "implacable enemies."
            </p>

            <p>
            But one need not be religious to see
            that Mises is spouting nonsense: humans
            (and proto-humans) lived together in
            tight-knit social groups long before they
            could have been calculating the advantages
            of the division of labor. There
            never were "isolated... self-sufficient
            individuals" with which they could
            compare their "output" as members
            of a group: isolated humans were dead humans,
            not self-sufficent humans. And our
            chimpanzee, bonobo, and gorilla relatives
            also live in tight-knit social groups,
            and certainly do not regard the other
            members of the group as "implacable enemies."
            (Take a gander at the group of
            "implacable enemies" pictured at the
            top of this post!) In fact, cooperation is
            every bit as much a fact of animal life as is competition.
            </p>

            "The 'Noble Lie' of liberalism is shattering
            because it continues to be believed and defended
            by those who benefit from it, while it
            is increasingly seen as a lie,
            and not an especially noble one, by
            the new servant class that liberalism has produced... But
            liberalism's apologists regard pervasive
            discontent, political dysfunction,
            economic inequality, civic disconnection, and populist
            rejection as accidental problems
            disconnected from systemic causes,
            because their self-deception is
            generated by enormous reservoirs of
            self-interest in the maintenance of the present system." 
            p. 180
            </p>

            <p>
            Deneen makes a particularly important,
            and often misunderstood,
            point in the above quote: often,
            when it is pointed out that it is
            in the self-interest of commentator X
            to take view Y, someone will
            respond, "No, I am sure that X
            really believes Y!" But that
            response misses the point: when it
            is in our self-interest to
            believe Y, very often, we will
            not merely feign belief in Y, but
            actually talk ourselves into really
            believing Y: and we will
            convince ourselves that we believe it for the most admirable
            reasons. This self-deception is
            crucial to the maintenance of our
            self-image as good, modern "free
            thinkers": it just happens that
            our "free thinking" has led us to
            just the views that most help us
            get on in life! What a blessing!
            </p>
            
            <p>
            No, Deneen is not a reactionary fantasist
            and no, he does not deny liberalism's accomplishments:
            </p>

            <p>
            "First, the achievements of liberalism
            must be acknowledged, and
            the desire to 'return' to a preliberal
            age must be eschewed. We
            must build upon those achievements while abandoning the
            foundational reasons for its failures.
            There can be no going back,
            only forward." p. 182
            </p>

            <p>
            This passage highlights a danger I
            noted in Oakeshott on Rome and
            America: while for several centuries
            Romans simply respected and
            followed the mos maiorum, the way
            of the ancestors, when their
            traditions began to break down, there arose a brand new
            traditionalist ideology. Whereas
            previously Rome's traditions had
            been followed in an organic way,
            one which allowed them to also be
            organically modified, once they
            began to break down, a faction
            arose demanding that those traditions
            be turned into rules, and that those rules
            must be followed without deviation (and thus
            without allowing any organic response
            to changing circumstances).
            </p>

            <p>
            And this is an error that too many modern conservatives have
            committed: they wish to return to
            the 1950s, or the 1920s, or the
            1890s, or 1783, or whatever other period they admire. Such a
            return, as Deneen clearly recognizes,
            is impossible. We can try to
            preserve the best aspects of earlier times,
            but we cannot ever just recreate them.
            And after all, even if we could, given that those
            earlier times brought about our present
            situation, wouldn't we just repeat the exact
            same progression that has led to the present
            situation that nostalgic conservatives deplore?
            </p>

            <p>
            Instead, to move forward, Deneen insists that, while
            we must look to the lessons of the past, and recognize
            that not all wisdom is contained in the latest
            trendy soundbite from some esteemed pundit, we have
            to admit that the present is always novel in many
            ways, and that the past provides no blueprint for how
            to act now. (The idea that we <i>could</i> act
            according to a blueprint is a rationalist conceit.)
            </p>

            <p>
            Perhaps most importantly, Deneen recognizes that
            what is most needed are new <i>practices</i>, and
            not new <i>theories</i>. The basic error of all
            three modern ideologies is the idea that practical
            life can be conducted on a theoretical basis. But
            this like turning to abstract philosophers for their
            street savvy.
