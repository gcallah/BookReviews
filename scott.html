                     A Deep History of the Earliest States

            <p>
                James C. Scott gave two lectures at Harvard in 2011 on
                domestication and the earliest states. But the discussion
                afterwards, by a panel of experts, convinced him that his
                arguments "were not remotely ready for prime time" (x). So he
                plunged into five years of research on these topics, and the
                result is this work under review.
