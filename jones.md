"Berkeley's documented life and participation in various institutions and
practices, such as those of the exclusive educational institutions of a
Protestant elite, is inseparable from his treatment of major philosophical and
social issues" (3).

This is an extremely strong contention: Jones does not contend that on
occasion, we might get insight into a thinker's philosophical position by
examining that thinker's biography. No, he claims that someone's philosophical
ideas are "Inseparable" from their biography. Should we except or reject
immaterialism based on what we think of how Berkeley led his life? Many people
have read Berkeleys argument for immaterialism and discussed it without knowing
anything about his biography. Were they all mistaken to do so? And how about
this very book under review: if I hope to understand this book, do I need to go
read a biography of Jones? If Jones's contention is true, it would seem that
every intellectual work ought to be accompanied by a biography of the person
who wrote it.
