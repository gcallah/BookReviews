Political theorists have recently devoted
a great amount of attention to justifying
political decisions based on theories of "public reason" or "deliberative democracy." The impetus for this focus has been
the realization that defending choices simply the basis that "most people agreed to this, therefore it is OK"
is clearly flawed: e.g., simply because the majority in some polity agree that
redheads are bad and should be avoided does not render a law to exile all of them just.

To roughly characterize the "deliberative" turn, these theorists have argued that a law or policy is only valid if it
can be "reasonably" defended to all those who will be subject to its dictates. This justification cannot call upon
traditional dictates for judging such decisions, since the point of the exercise is to reach consensus among people from
widely different traditions. Holston sets out to demonstrate that, in fact, there
are no reasonable criteria for barring certain opinions as unreasonable, apart from the very traditions that are
supposedly ruled out. Liberalism itself is a tradition, with its own traditional answers to such questions.

Holston's approach to his topic is interesting and important
in that it occupies a middle ground between two extremes: On the one hand, many of the followers of Leo Strauss hold
that any "historicism," such as taking into account historical circumstances when considering how some polity ought to
be governed, simply leads to surrendering virtue to the seductive song of moral relativism. On the other hand, there are
historicists, such as Oswald Spengler or Richard Rorty,
for whom historicism does indeed imply moral relativism. But Holston, like his mentor Claes Ryn,
argues that, while transcendent moral truths exist, we only can move towards realizing them through concrete historical
mores, practices, and cultures.

Holston declares that his approach is historical in two senses, firstly, "it views this discussion regarding deliberation
itself as taking place over time" (2). Secondly, his approach is historical "in the sense that it aims to bring to
bear on this conversation a sensitivity to the historical nature of deliberation in any society" (3).

Hoston then traces the genesis of consensus-based democratic theory. He takes Rousseau as his starting
point (while acknowledging ealier roots exist); specifically, Rousseau's concept of the "general will" is clearly a precursor
to modern public reason theories. Along the way,
Holston argues that Rousseau set himself in opposition to the materialism of Thomas Hobbes, and in particular, "the
sanction of the political doctrine that might makes right." (19)

But did Hobbes really hold that "might makes right"?  That seems a rather crude interpretation of what he was up to. Of
course the sovereign possesses might, but that is not what makes it right to obey him: it is rather that this might
enables him to call a truce in the war of all against all. If he used his might to, for instance, wipe out his own
subjects, Hobbes would certainly not claim that this makes it right.

Another salient precursor to modern deliberative democratic theory, per Holston, is Immanuel Kant. Kant emphasized the role of
universal, abstract reason freed from any bondage to custom in making moral choices. This is most famously expressed in
his "categorical imperative," which holds that one should always act as if one's action were an example of
a universal law. Holston notes that "where the ancients had once seen the laws formalism is simultaneously an advantage,
and a disadvantage in the resolution of moral and political questions, Kant saw only the former..." (57) The 

Holston continues: "Over the course of the last several decades, the autonomy tradition of Rousseau and Kant has enjoyed
somewhat of a renaissance in contemporary democratic theory" (63). As mentioned above, 
this has been due to dissatisfaction with the previously ascendant view that the virtue of democracy lies in its
promoting the individual preferences of as many people as possible, since this may permit a majority to run roughshod
over the rights of a minority. Holston cites Jurgen Habermas, from the continental philosophical tradition, and John
Rawls, from the analytic tradition, as being the two key founders of this renaissance. 

Habermas leans towards the deliberation aspect of political justification. He stresses the use of unrestricted
deliberation to reach universal agreement, which is clearly akin to Rousseau's general will. In this process of
deliberation, the discussants must "distance themselves temporarily from the mormative specctrum of all existing life"
(quoted on 82). In other words, they must lift themselves completely out of their own cultural background and
historical circumstances, and achieve a "view from nowhere."

Rawls, on the other hand, is more of a child of Kant, as he is more concerned with the justice of outcomes than in
deliberation per se. One's political choices must be defensible *in principle* to any "reasonable" citizen: it is not as
important, as it is to Habermas, that they have *actually* been so defended. Rawls aim is to arrive at political
principles that can be agreed-upon by all participants, whatever "comprehensive doctrine" they embrace. (Comprehensive
doctrines are worldviews like Christianity, Buddhism, secular humanism, and so on.) The result is abstractions vague
enough that different interpreters can use them to justify almost any policies they preferred anyway, so that there are
both socialists and libertarians who consider themselves to be applying Rawls' principles.

Holston rests his case for the utopian nature of public reason theories largely on the work of the German philosopher
Hans-Georg Gadamer. Gadamer's theory of "hermeneutics" emphasized the importance of customary practices and mores as the
basis for genuine deliberation. If Gadamer is correct, then we can not expect public deliberation to reach any sort of
consensus over large populations with fundamentally divergent "comprehensive doctrines."

A curious phenomenon noted by Holston is the tendency of writers in the deliberative tradtion to
regard the current moral pluralism exhibited in a country such as the US (where, for instance, some people consider
abortion to be murder, while others consider it simply healthcare) as a result of an irreversible jump into "modernity."
For instance, Habermas claims "Modernity sees itself cast back upon itself without any possibility of escape" (quoted on
165). What is strange about these claims is that the collapse of a civilizational consensus into pluralism happened
before, when the Greco-Roman pagan worldview fell apart and we had the huge proliferation of cults around the Roman
empire. But the increase of pluralism *was* reversed, and the outcome was Christendom.

Holston is neither a dogmatist nor a nostalgic reactionary. He fully recognizes that the conditions faced by a
continent-spanning, multi-ethnic republic, like the United States, are very different from those
of a Greek polis, or a medieval kingdom; thus, the United States could not be well governed
simply by importing the political practice of such polities. But he does argue, and successfully, in my view,
that the balance in modern politics has tilted entirely too far toward the cosmopolitan and the universal,
and has ignored the local and particular. The result is that our politics is directed largely by a global elite that
lays claim to having a properly cosmopolitan and universal point of view, leaving the average citizen largely
voiceless.

It is only at a local level that true political deliberation among citizens can take place. Holston's central message is
that, if deliberative democrats are serious about their enterprise, they ought to be working to devolve decision making
to the local level as far as possible.
