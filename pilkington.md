The correct argument against the 10-hour clock is that the French revolutionaries had been hypnotized by the fact that
they counted in base 10 into thinking that measuring everything in multiples of ten was somehow more rational than
any other multipler, such as 12 or 24. And therefore there was no reason to do away with dividing the day into 24 hours: no division is
more rational than any other, and so it is more sensible to use the conventional divisor, and not disrupt everyone's time
keeping to switch to a different, and equally arbitrary, divisor.

But Pilkington instead claims: "the 24-hour day and the calendar that grows out of it are based on lived reality of
night and day as it occurs on earth" (36).

Certainly, our lived reality tells us that some part of each day is dark, and some part is light. 
But nothing about our lived reality demands that we divide each day into 24 hours. In Japan, for instance, the day and
the night were each divided into six "hours." In Muslim countries, the main divisions of the day are the times of the
five daily prayers. In ancient India, the day was divided into eigth *prahars*. And in medieval Europe, monasteries
divided the day by the eight times of prayer: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. These
traditional divisions were, in fact, more in tune with our lived reality, as they typically varied these divisions as
the daylight period grew shorter or longer. It was only with the widespread usage of mechanical clocks that the idea of
dividing the day into 24 equal periods became common: It was itself a fitting of our lived experience into the
requirements of a machine.


Pilkington writes: "There are many variants of the classic metaphysic, from Platonism to Aristotelianism and everything
in between" (30). But R.G. Collingwood, Lloyd P. Gerson, Eric Voegelin and other have argued that Aristotle in fact only
represented a slight shift from Plato's views, giving somewhat more emphasis to immanence than to transcendence. The
ancient world contained a much wider variety of metaphysical thought, such as the materialism of Democritus and
Lucretius or the work of the pre-Socratics such as Thales, Anaximander, Parmenides and Zeno, to say nothing of Eastern
metaphysics.
