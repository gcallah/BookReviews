            "the rise and dominance of markets for land, labour, and capital
            are self-undermining, as... feedback mechanisms results in welfare
            declining again and markets losing their quality in facilitating
            successful and rapid exchange, with a relative or even absolute
            downfall of the market economy in question." (pg. 2)

            "When peasants in developing countries lose their direct access to
            land and the means of production, and become reliant on markets for
            food, land, and wage labour, they can actually become more
            dependent and even more vulnerable than they would have been in a
            peasant society with limited market influence..." -- Bas van Bavel,
            The Invisible Hand?, p. 6

            "The Iraqi elites started to immobilize their wealth in <i>waqf</i>s, or
            religious and charitable foundations, partly in order to shield it
            from taxation by the state. The <i>waqf</i>, as an unincorporated and
            inalienable trust, appeared on the stage around the mid-eighth
            century and grew in importance by the ninth century, especially in
            Iraq... A major motive for the foundation of a <i>waqf</i> was the wish to
            serve a religious, charitable, or public purpose... For the
            founder, some additional advantages of using this instrument was
            that he could appoint himself as an administrator of the <i>waqf</i>, he
            could set his own salary to be paid out of the <i>waqf</i>'s funds, he
            could nominate relatives to positions paid for by the <i>waqf</i>, And he
            could designate his children as his successors. This last advantage
            help to circumvent the Islamic inheritance laws… What the same time
            he could shield the family property from taxation by public
            authorities." Bas van Bavel, The Invisible Hand?, p. 76
