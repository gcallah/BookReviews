            Automated unit testing is a crucial part of the 
            "Agile" and "DevOps" approaches to software creation
            and deployment. The ability to get code into production with great
            regularity (companies good at this may deploy code into
            production hundreds or thousands of times per day)
            requires that code is regularly and thoroughly tested as it
            is developed, and not just "thrown over the wall" into
            QA just before it is released.
            To achieve this result, it is necessary to write automated
            tests (since such thorough, regular testing simply cannot
            be done "by hand" by busy developers) that cover all common
            use cases (including erroneous use) and that give clear 
            reports on what problems, if any, have been uncovered.
            A good test framework makes such a test suite easy to write,
            and integrates well into build tools such as <i>make</i>
            and <i>Jenkins</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Given the importance of automated testing to these
            contemporary development styles, Ashwin Pajankar's
            book is a timely addition to the literature.
            He has written a nice introduction
            to unit test automation in Python,
            albeit one with several flaws.  If one needs a succinct
            overview of this topic, this book will certainly do the job,
            </p>

            <p>
            Pajankar surveys five main testing
            frameworks: <i>doctest</i>, a very
            elementary testing framework in which tests are written into 
            Python comments, <i>unittest</i>, Python's built-in,
            more sophisticated testing module, <i>nose</i> and <i>nose2</i>,
            two extensions of <i>unittest</i>, and finally <i>pytest</i>.
            As the author points out,
            <i>Doctest</i> is too primitive a tool to use for 
            continuous-integration-style development. Its tests are limited
            to comparing single examples against a known value -- an important
            aspect of more sophiticated testing is the ability to test
            against random, unexpected input -- but Pajankar
            is justified in using it to introduce the concept
            of unit testing, due to this very simplicity.
            </p>

            <p>
            After describing the various pros and cons of
            <i>unittest</i>, <i>nose</i> and <i>nose2</i>,
            Pajankar recommends the <i>pytest</i> as the best choice,
            due to its wealth of features and compatibility with both
            <i>unittest</i>- and <i>nose</i>-style tests.
            </p>

            <p>
            The first problematic thing that struck
            me about this book is that Chapter One
            seems a very strange inclusion.
            The chapter is a very brief, high-level
            introduction to the Python programming language, aimed at someone
            who knows almost nothing about it. But...
            Is that reader likely to buy a book called <i>Python Unit Test
            Automation</i> as their first introduction to the language?! Won't they
            pick up something with a name like <i>Beginning Python</i>?
            </p>

            <p>
            This book also includes a very large number of screen shots and copies
            of the output of running some command or other. Now certainly, a
            bit of this can be useful. 
            But I suggest that, say, for a series of very similar
            tests, it is enough to put in, "Here is an example of the output of
            test A," and not also show the nearly identical output for tests B,
            C, D and E.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are also some minor technical problems in this work.
            For instance, Pajankar claims "You must use [the verbose mode of
            doctest] because without it, the test will not produce any output
            unless it fails" (25). However, in many cases,
            that outcome might be exactly what
            one wants: produce output only on failure.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another technical quibble is that Pajankar apparently does not
            understand the meaning of the "all" keyword in a __init__.py file.
            He asserts that one has to include
            a file in the "all" section of __init__.py to 
            make it part of that directory's package. But that is wrong:
            what including a file in "all" does is to make it imported
            when one writes "from <i>package</i> import *".
            </p>

            <p>
            Also, on page 57, Pajankar writes,
            "Many times, you might want to have a method that
            explicitly fails a test when it's called." But he does not offer
            any explanation of what those "many times" might be. For someone
            trying to learn how to write good tests, an example or two 
            here would have been very valuable.
            </p>

            <p>
            Despite this book's shortcomings, it provides a clear introduction
            to the options available for Python unit test automation, while
            at the same time introducing many general points about what
            one needs in a testing framework. For anyone who has begun
            writing Python programs, but is unsure about how to write
            automated tests for those programs, this book provides excellent
            guidance on how to get started.
