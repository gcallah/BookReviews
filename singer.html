            It is unfortunate for Singer that not long before reviewing his
            book, I taught a class in C++ using Bjarne Stroustrup's 
            book <i>Programming: Principles and Practices Using C++</i>.
            Stroustrup, in four chapters (out of 26) has the reader
            build a small calculator including separate lexical
            analysis, recursive-descent parsing, variables, and more.
            I thought <i>Practical C++ Design</i> would be a great
            follow-up: I would surely pick up ways to extend the
            calculator I had built, following Stroustrup, from
            Singer. But to my surprise, Singer takes a whole book to
            design a calculator less fully realized than Stroustrup's.
