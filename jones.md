"Berkeley's documented life and participation in various institutions and
practices, such as those of the exclusive educational institutions of a
Protestant elite, is inseparable from his treatment of major philosophical and
social issues" (3).

This is an extremely strong contention: Jones does not contend that on
occasion, we might get insight into a thinker's philosophical position by
examining that thinker's biography. No, he claims that someone's philosophical
ideas are "Inseparable" from their biography. Should we except or reject
immaterialism based on what we think of how Berkeley led his life? Many people
have read Berkeleys argument for immaterialism and discussed it without knowing
anything about his biography. Were they all mistaken to do so? And how about
this very book under review: if I hope to understand this book, do I need to go
read a biography of Jones? If Jones's contention is true, it would seem that
every intellectual work ought to be accompanied by a biography of the person
who wrote it. 

"Being an agent cannot be like unto, or represented by, any idea whatsoever..."
(9)


"But it is perhaps surprising the Berkeley’s immaterialism, his insistence
that there is only one substance — spirit — and that ideas are merely passive
effects of spirits to exist in willing some conceived and quite possibly
indistinct good, lends its support to a biographical approach to his
philosophy." (12-13)

" another tendency in Berkeley‘s thought that has not previously been
elaborated... Is the tendency to present thinking and acting as participating in...
Divinity" (13)

"Perhaps not everyone feels that Berkeley’s God is an embarrassment..." (15)

Jones's understanding of the physics and mathematics he discusses is not always
adequate to the task. For instance, at one point he calls fluxions "the forces
that cause changes in motion" (55): but this is nonsense. "Fluxion" was
Newton's term for an instantaneous rate of change, and had nothing to do with
what force might be causing that change.


Jones mentions that by the time he left Dublin, many of Barclays "enduring and
idiosyncratic  tendencies" (141) had already become apparent. Among these is
contention that the world "is a world of ideas" (141): This illustrates a
degree of continuity amongst the British idealists that is often denied, for
refined Michael Oakeshott making the exact same contention in 1933.

Jones then goes on to say, "For all that the world may appear to have
physical being, tangible or visible extension, its real existence is as ideas"
(141). This is a mistake made by many interpreters of Berkeley: he is **not**
claiming that there is no physical world, or tangible or visible extension. He
is claiming that the world's physicality is **itself** an idea, as is
extension. These things are not illusions that must be dispelled by Berkeley's
philosophy: they are realities whose basis is explained by it.

"Here, as in so many other locations in seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century social thought,
the possibility that rank produces, or is otherwise complicit in, the
adumbration of natural rights to justice and equity is mysteriously invisible"
(192).

Jones should remember the parochialism is not limited to earlier ages: It is
quite possible that a social thinker from the 1700s would note how mysterious it
is that 21st-century social thinkers believe that rank is in conflict with
natural rights to justice and equity.


In discussing Berkeley's travels in England, Italy, and America, Jones
highlights how prominent thoughts on social improvement were in B's life. Even
his most famous "metaphysical" works partook of this tendency, as they were
foremost intended as a means of defeating skepticism and atheism, which B saw
as serious threats to social order.

B's wife is quoted as saying, "He has taken from them the ground they stand on,
& had he built as he has pulled down he had been down a master builder indeed
but Unto every Man his Work some must remove rubbish, & others lay
Foundations..." Jones's Questionable reading of this quote is that "Berkeley's
wife taught him more destructive than productive as a philosopher" (304). But
Mrs. Berkeley said that what he was pulling down was "rubbish," and surely
removing rubbish is a constructive, not a destructive, activity.

B's project of founding a university in Bermuda is a strange episode in his
career, although Jones makes a good case that it should be understood as a
facet of his larger project of Anglican education.

While discussing this topic, Jones makes a curious claim: "But his Bermuda
project was obliquely complicit in the modern, import-oriented economy he
despised and the full range of human cruelty is it required -- bondage, and
forced movement of populations, and eradication of indigenous peoples and their
ways of life and habitats" (348). Even though Berkeley plan to raise funds for
his project through selling small land holdings on St. Christopher (St.
Kitts), nevertheless this would "obliquely but ultimately require the dystopia
of plantation colonialism and slavery" (348).

First of all, it is not at all clear what Jones means by "require" here: We
found universities today, even on remote islands, without "requiring"
plantation colonialism and slavery. It is true that what wound up happening on
St. Christopher was that the land was dominated by large, slave-worked
plantations. But this happened without Berkeley being involved in the land
sales, and without his college ever being built. One can never prove historical
counterfactuals, but perhaps if his scheme has gone
through, the outcome on St. Christopher would have been different.

But even odder Is this notion of "oblique" responsibility: Once we adopt such a
flimsy standard for placing blame, it seems we have to condemn everyone alive
at the moment some unsavory event was occurring: Weren't even the Native
Americans and the slaves "obliquely" responsible for the what happened?

In discussing Berkeley's work *Alciphron*, Jones seems overly anxious to assure
the reader that Berkeley's "right thinkers" Are just as subject to prejudice as
are his "free thinkers." For instance, Jones quotes Berkeley as writing,

"[W]ho would choose for his Guide in the Search of Truth, a Man...
whose Education hath been behind a Counter, or in an Office?
Or whose Speculations have been employed on the Forms of Business,
who are only well read in the ways and commerce of Mankind, in
Stock-jobbing, Purloining, Supplanting, Bribing?"

Jones comments:

"In the choice of what kind of human character we wish to be
led by... What's her personally take to have clear and extensive use, credo is
set against anyone working in business and finance. This prejudice seems as
unfounded as the freethinking prejudiced for nobility of rank..."

However, Jones is left out important part of the quote from *Alciphron*; Crito
also recommends against taking as a guide "a Man whose Thoughts and Time are
taken up with Dress, Visits, and Diversions" (*Alciphron*, Second Dialogue,
section XIX). Once we combine that with his "*only* well read", it is clear
that Crito is claiming that a mind *consumed* by thoughts of fashion and
socializing, or by thoughts of financial gain, will not make a good
philosopher. That hardly seems to be a prejudice.


In a chapter called "The True End of Speech," Jones turns his attention to Berkeley
as a philosopher of language and semiotician. This is an aspect of Berkeley's
thought that has garnered a great deal of attention lately. (See, for instance
Kenneth Pearce's *Language and the Structure of Berkeley's World*.) Jones notes
that:

"The arguments Berkeley deploys in this account of language have a 20th century
field: his introduction of rules of conduct and changes of behavior as tests of
whether a term is meaningful are revolutionary. He has been thought a precursor
of Wittgenstein, Grice, and Austin." (384)
