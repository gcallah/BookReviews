Alexander Salter has written an important book, examining how the political program of distributism can inform
contemporary debates about political economy.
(I should note here that Salter and I co-wrote a paper on distributism, which is, in fact, cited in the book under review.)
The fact that Salter is a trained economist with a PhD is significant,
since it contradicts the idea that taking distributism seriously might be simply a symptom of ignorance of
"scientific" economics.
Despite Salter's sympathy with distributist thought, he never gives the architects of
distributism (chiefly G.K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc) a free pass: he continually tests whether their ideas appear
plausible given commonly accepted economic theory. Spoiler: in some cases they do appear so, but in others
Salter judges them to come up short.

Salter sets the scene for the core of his book with two chapters, the first on "common-good capitalism." That was the
theme of a speech by Senator Marco Rubio, in which Rubio claimed that, despite "years of robust economic growth, we still
have millions of people unable to find dignified work, and feeling forgotten, ignored, and left behind" (quoted
in Salter, pg. 1). After rejecting socialism as an answer to our problems, Rubio argued that the right response "is not
to abolish free enterprise but to moralize it" (2). And Salter points out that Rubio has hardly been alone among figures
broadly "on the right" who recently have been questioning laissez-faire ideology, noting a manifesto published in
*First Things* signed by "more than a dozen high-profile academics and public intellectuals" (3). Salter goes on to
discuss Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen and Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule as prominent examples of
intellectuals promoting a revived concern for the common good as necessary to cure what ails us, and notes that each of
them grounds his critique of the current order in Catholic social teaching. To close out the chapter, Salter points
out that "common-good capitalism" is not an example of a "third-way" economic system halfway between socialism and
capitalism. The common "third way" is the regulatory-redistrbutivist state, which, given its focus on "material comfort
and social pacification," is focused on "second-order problems," and thus ignores the first-order problem of "respecting
human dignity" (7). In particular, third-way solutions, such as social democracy, relying on distributing either
consumer goods directly (such as food stamps or housing vouchers) or indirectly via cash transfers, to those less well
off, as if upping their level of consumption alone could make their lives satisfying. Distributism, on the other hand,
focuses on individual ownership of *productive* property, which enables each individual to have the
dignity of greater direction of their own life.

In the next chapter, Salter offers a brief out line of Catholic social thought. The Church had always been engaged with
social issues, but the impetus for articulating a specifically Catholic approach to social issues was "the economic and
political upheavals in the West following the Industrial Revolution" (15). The foundational documents in this effort
were Pope Leo XIII's *Rerum Novarum* of 1891 and Pope Pius XI's *Quadragesimo Anno* of 1931.

In this chapter, Salter claims that "Industrialization greatly increased living standards..." (17). But recent research has shown that
in the nineteenth century the physical health of the rural populations of Scotland and Ireland was much better than that
of industrialized England. Unfortunately, Salter does not consider the impact of forced enclosures of common land,
cutting peasants off from an important source of their livelihood, on the mass movement of peasants into factory work.
He claims that "Many voluntarily left the countryside in pursuit of wage employment in cities..." (17), but this is
somewhat like saying that "I voluntarily moved into a homeless shelter, after my house was demolished by legislative
act."

In any case, the various pronouncements of the Catholic Church during this period asserted that, contra socialists,
private property is vital to human flourishing, but, contra economic liberals, property rights are not absolute: "The
state must regulate ownership and its attendant privileges in the interests of the common good" (18). Pope Pius added
the vital concept of *subsidiarity* to Leo's work: "higher-order communities [such as nations]...[must not] interfere
with the operation of lower-order communities [such as a village] without just cause" (18).

Salter begins his foray into the particulars of distributist thought with two chapters on the English writer Hilaire
Belloc, the first addressing his work, *The Servile State*. Belloc's work was influential enough that even a classical
liberal like F. A. Hayek quotes it in *The Road to Serfdom*, to wit: "The control of the production of wealth is the
control of human life itself" (quoted in Salter, page 30). Belloc's concern is that the property arrangements of
industrial capitalism, where the ownership of *productive* property is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, will
eventually lead to the re-establishment of a servile state such as was common in the ancient world, where most work was
done by largely unfree labor for the benefit of a ruling elite. Belloc would not be impressed by neo-liberal defenses of
current arrangements based upon noting that contemporary workers can own very large SUVs and plasma-screen TVs: it is
ownership of the means of *production* that makes a person free to direct his own days.

Salter also argues that Belloc's contention that large firms exploit their workers is naive, since workers receive
"the value they contribute to the production process" (42). But is this really how workers are paid?
When it comes to individual workers, the idea is preposterous: I have
been employed by many companies and not a single one of them ever had any idea what the "marginal product" of any individual
worker was. When it comes to different categories of laborer, or to workers as a whole, it would be true that they would get paid
their marginal product in Mises "imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy": but Mises was quite clear that
this is an *imaginary* construction. So even setting aside political interventions and power dynamics, there is still
room for Belloc's argument to have validity. 

The next chapter takes up Belloc's work *An Essay on the Restoration of Property*. Here, Belloc admits that sometimes
giant economic conglomerates may sometimes be more efficient and even more innovative than small concerns. But he does
not believe that these possible benefits are worth the cost in human freedom and dignity that such bigness entails.
For Belloc, policies designed to lift workers' wages while ignoring who owns the means of production
miss the crucial fact that "A wage employee does not possess
economic freedom, regardless of how high his wage is. Freedom requires ownership..." (Belloc quoted in Salter 50).
Better to pursue policies that favor "small retailers and craftsmen," who own their own productive property, than to try
to make the servile condition of a wage laborer slighlty more palatable.

Salter next turns his attention to G.K. Chesterton, first addressing his book, *What's Wrong with the World*. Like
Belloc, Chesterton rejects both capitalism and socialism. Socialism denies any value to private property, while
capitalism allows excessive holdings of property by a small number of individuals.
Chesterton notes, "One would think, to hear people talk, that the
Rothschilds and Rockefellers were on the side of property. But obviously they are the enemies of property, because they are
enemies of their own limitations" (quoted on Salter 75).
Critiquing programs housing the poor in state-provided "council flats" or "housing projects," Chesterton writes:
"Man needs not just a shelter but a *home*, and socialism cannot distinguish between the two." (92)

But these criticisms of socialism should not lead one to believe that Chesterton is a Tory.
Chesterton sees the battle between Tories and socialists as little more than a pantomime, disguising the awful
possibility that they are "secretly in partnership; the quarrel they keep up in public is very much of a put-up job; and
that the way in which they perpetually play into each other's hands is not an everlasting coincidence (92-93)

In response to a "progressive" proposal that all of the children of the poor should be mandated to have short hair, to
prevent outbreaks of louse infestation, Chesterton noted that
"It never seems to strike these people that the lesson of lice in the slums is the wrongness of slums, not the
wrongness of hair." (93)

The second book of Chesterton's that Salter looks at is *The Outline of Sanity*, which is "as much about politics as
economics" (99). Here Chesterton attacks bigness and monopoly in both the public and the private sphere, the purpose of
which is "social control, the modern phrase for the age-old institution of Slavery" (quoted on Salter 99). Chesterton
also defends democracy in this book, while denying it is opposed to tradition: "tradition is only democracy extended
through time... All democrats object to men being disqualified by the accident of birth; tradition objects to their
being disqualified by the accident of death" (quoted on Salter 101).

Salter spends some time criticizing Chesterton's contention that large firms are inefficient, but here it is Salter who
does not seem to have "kept step," as he ignores the Toyota revolution in manufacturing, and the proven superiority of
small teams in rapidly producing quality software.


Salter goes on to discuss Mary Hirschfeld's work *Aquinas and the Market*. Hirschfeld notes that while economics
discusses efficiency, in terms of what means are employed to achieve any ends whatsoever, Aquinas holds that "human choice
is not about efficiently getting what we want so much as it is about learning how to want what is genuinely good" (Hirshfeld quoted on Salter 144).
There is no virtue in being very efficient about achieving evil ends. Salter contends that
while Hirshfeld's work points us towards a humane *economics*, Belloc and Chesterton's program is about creating a
humane *economy*. Thus, Salter concludes, these are two complementary research programs that should be united.

Another key figure for Salter is the German economist Wilhelm Röpke, who married Belloc and Chesterton's concerns about
proletarianization and the inhuman scale of modern life with a rigorous knowledge of economic price theory. Salter devotes
two chapters to Röpke, the first to show that his social concerns are remarkably similar to those of Bellow and
Chesterton (both of whom Röpke cites), and the second to demonstrate his grasp of economic theory and its importance to
his recommendations for reform.

Röpke exemplifies why
being able to "think like an economist" is important for anyone who truly wishes to improve society. A failure to do so
is likely to result in policies that not only fail to acheive their goal, but even may achieve the opposite. For
instance, many people concerned about the well-being of low-wage workers advocate setting a high minimum wage.
But where can the minimum wage be set so that it is "correct' for a parent supporting several children,
for one member of a couple going back to work part time while the other is working full-time,
for a single person living on their own,
for a teenager living at home with their parents,
and for someone with some other means of support who is trying to get going in some highly
desirable line of work. Belloc, Chesterton, and Röpke would all
agree that, better than trying to artificially prop up the wage of a proletarian worker, let's de-proletarianize him.
(And, by the way, so would Marx and Engels, who disdained reforms like minimum wage legislation.)

As someone who has repeatedly committed the venial sin of reviewing academic books, I find too many academic writers
seem to believe that the best way of showing one's intelligence is to write obscurely. Salter does not suffer from that
illusion: his writing is always pellucid. A minor quibble: Salter does employ the contemporary, nearly instinctual habit
of announcing in advance and retrospectively repeating one's main argument. At one point he writes, "It will be helpful
to summarize the arguments thus far" (127). My reaction was, "Not really: I have been following along." I cannot recall
a single classic work of philosophy, social theory, or history that follows this method: I think it is a journalistic
trick appropriate for casual readers of newspapers that has unfortunately leaked into academic writing.


If I might be so bold as to try to capture the "main message" of Salters book, it might be that:

1. Those who attempt social reform without understanding price theory are likely to make foolish mistakes that result in
   the opposite effect of what they wished to achieve.
2. Those who rely only on price theory in devising, social policy, are likely to make in human mistakes that ignore all
   the things about people and their common life that cannot be captured in a supply-and-demand diagram.

My minor quibbles aside, this is an excellent book, Which should serve as an important introduction to distributism
for both economists and non-economists.
