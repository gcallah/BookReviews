5: “science as yet.”

8: depression 

“deaths of despair”

9: “ in fact, through a framework that brings together principles of evolutionary biology, psychology, sociology, and
philosophy, we can infer that there is a purpose to our existence, but *what this purpose is*”

Five principles 

16: Men responsible for violence 


17: evolution is God‘s tool



football game: those bodies were just moving around according to the laws of physics 


Convergent evolution 




The problem with the book 


Science is not the sort of activity that can answer a question, in the affirmative or negative, such as "does life have
meaning?" to expect science to answer question like this it's like expecting your plumber to tell you why excretion is
part of human life.




Randomness itself is a scientific concept 

39: just wrong: there is no need to "bring these views closer together"

40: "a God who left creation entirely up to chance."

41: "nothing in our study of human nature makes sense except in light of human evolution"

Hard-wired


The relationship of science to the concrete world can be likened to the relationship of a blueprint to the actual
building it represents. The blueprint can be very valuable, both in the construction of the building, and in its
maintenance and modifications later on. But it would be ridiculous to use the blueprint to show the occupants of the
building that it does not contain any desks or chairs, since they do not appear on the blueprint.

Some nihilistic materialists have attempted to do a similar maneuver: since they do not find a purpose for our existence
anywhere in the abstraction that is science, they tell people that there *is* no purpose, and that life is meaningless.
Wilkinson wants to counter them by claiming that it is possible to find purpose and meaning in the blueprint. While I
appreciate the spirit behind this effort, in doing so, he is making the same category error as are those whom he wishes
to refute. One cannot point to a blueprint to prove or disprove what is inside a building, and one cannot point to
science to disprove *or* prove that life has meaning.
