Samuel T. Wilkinson, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University, has written a fascinating, albeit flawed book. It is
one in a long line of attempts to show that science and religion are compatible. But, as we will conclude, this is an
unnecessary effort: it is like demonstrating that line dancing does not contradict plumbing.

Wilkinson begins his book in Nashville, Tennessee, in January of 1925.
The scene is the famous Scopes trial, in which the ACLU had found a teacher (John Scopes)
willing to test Tennessee's new law forbidding the teaching of evolution. The trial drew two famous attorneys, William
Jennings Bryan for the prosecution, and Clarence Darrow for the defense, thousands of spectators, and attention from
newspapers nationwide.

5: "science as yet."

8: depression 

"deaths of despair"

9: " in fact, through a framework that brings together principles of evolutionary biology, psychology, sociology, and
philosophy, we can infer that there is a purpose to our existence, but *what this purpose is*"

Five principles 

16: Men responsible for violence 


17: evolution is God's tool



football game: those bodies were just moving around according to the laws of physics 


Convergent evolution 


90: "Evolution has biologically primed us to care deeply for our children *and to enjoy caring for them*."

But if we naturally enjoy this, then doing so is not actually a sacrifice!

The same with the experiments Wilkinson cites: if people find altruism enjoyable, then this is easily accounted for in a
rational choice model. To the extent we get enjoyment from "altruism," then there is no more puzzling by people help
others than it is why they go skiing or take motorcycle rides out in the country: they enjoy it.

109: "our drive to cooperate is a natural predisposition"

115: "In other words, our capacity for good might not have developed without our capacity for evil."

But "good" and "evil "are not biological concepts.

123: "Any evolving male hominid who impregnated many female partners would obviously reap significant evolutionary benefit."

There is no benefit that accrues to the individual.

Perhaps, like Elon Musk, I am proud of having sired many children.


125: "In fact, sexual jealousy is a leading cause of homicide and spousal abuse."

Sex is not a merely private matter.

Sometimes Wilkinson falls into the trap of talking about evolution or nature as if these things were themselves agents,
rather than just abstract aspects of the world of human experience. For instance, discussing the difficulty of having an
infant with a large head pass through a woman's birth canal, he asks, "What was nature's solution?"

But "nature", unless we embrace some form of pantheism, is not the sort of thing that can have problems that need to be solved. Why
would it be a problem for "nature" if all hominids went extinct?

To regard this as a problem that nature had to solve, is already to smuggle in the idea that there is an agent involved with goals.

133: romantic love is not a western invention

Free will

"Another one of the most remarkable examples of emergence is how the mind emerges from the brain."

But this is just an undefended assumption.

The Harvard law of animal behavior: "Under controlled experimental conditions of temperature, time, lighting, feeding,
and training, the organism will behave as it damn well pleases."

Epiphenomenalism

If our conscious thoughts are merely epiphenomena, why the heck should they have evolved?



In discussing the issue of free will Wilkinson touches on the famous experiments by Libet.

Simply showing that there is neural activity before a choice is consciously made does nothing to demonstrate that
humans do not make genuine choices.

A company's accounting system

"See, it's mathematics that caused the companies profitability, not anything the employees did!"




167: "The second dilemma was refuted..."


169: "This purpose is to choose between these competing natures"

What kind of purpose is that?

Making some choice or other, cannot be our purpose in life, since we can only make choices based upon some purpose we
have. For instance, if I am driving from my home in South Carolina to New York, I have a choice between I-81 and I-95 as
the main highway I will follow northward. If the purpose of my drive is to arrive as fast as possible in New York, I
will choose I-95. But if my purpose is to enjoy wonderful scenery along the way, I will choose I-81. Making a choice
cannot be our primary purpose, since having any basis for the choice at all presupposes some larger purpose. If I have a
choice between eating a high calorie dessert or not, my choice will depend upon whether I have the purpose of losing
weight, or enjoying myself in the moment.

A consistent nihilist will simply respond to Wilkinson's choice by claiming "It just doesn't matter: choose whatever you want. In the end, it doesn't amount to anything."

After all, if making this choice is my purpose in life, and I decide "OK, let me fulfill my basis, most selfish
desires," then, per Wilkinson, I have achieved that purpose: I made the choice. If he wants to contend that by doing so,
I made the wrong choice, which I think he would contend, then he must criticize my choice based upon its failure to
achieve some purpose beyond the choice itself.

My suspicion here is that Wilkinson, being a Christian, will consider it obvious that we should choose our better
nature, since that is the path to salvation. And that is fine, except that then our purpose is not to make this choice,
but to achieve salvation, and that is quite definitely not something biological science can recommend to us.



182-183: John B Watson's terrible advice for mothers


191: marriage makes people happier

194: relationships make us happier

But neither of those findings contradict the idea that we are just biological machines, programmed to behave in certain ways by "evolution." so, evolution "wants" me to be monogamous and value relationship relationships.

202: "surely this is the case"

207: no mention of Plato

211: one political commentator

214: unfortunately






The problem with the book 


Science is not the sort of activity that can answer a question, in the affirmative or negative, such as "does life have
meaning?" to expect science to answer question like this it's like expecting your plumber to tell you why excretion is
part of human life.




Randomness itself is a scientific concept 

39: just wrong: there is no need to "bring these views closer together"

40: "a God who left creation entirely up to chance."

41: "nothing in our study of human nature makes sense except in light of human evolution"

Hard-wired


The relationship of science to the concrete world can be likened to the relationship of a blueprint to the actual
building it represents. The blueprint can be very valuable, both in the construction of the building, and in its
maintenance and modifications later on. But it would be ridiculous to use the blueprint to show the occupants of the
building that it does not contain any desks or chairs, since they do not appear on the blueprint.

Some nihilistic materialists have attempted to do a similar maneuver: since they do not find a purpose for our existence
anywhere in the abstraction that is science, they tell people that there *is* no purpose, and that life is meaningless.
Wilkinson wants to counter them by claiming that it is possible to find purpose and meaning in the blueprint. While I
appreciate the spirit behind this effort, in doing so, he is making the same category error as are those whom he wishes
to refute. One cannot point to a blueprint to prove or disprove what is inside a building, and one cannot point to
science to disprove *or* prove that life has meaning.
