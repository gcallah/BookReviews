            Peter Lamb. Socialism.
         	Cambridge ; Medford, Massachusetts : Polity Press, 2019.           
            135 pages.

        <p>
            Lamb, for instance, notes Sarkar’s claim that “many people in
            capitalist developing countries could only dream of the economic
            living standards of the German democratic republic” (5). True,
            acrylic my reply, but the east German workers we’re enjoying a
            standard of living that had declined from Germany’s capitalist
            past, while those in developing countries were experiencing rising
            standards of living as their nations had become more capitalist.
            The critics claim may or may not be true: the point I wish to make
            here is that Lamb typically does not even consider such opposing
            points of view to his.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamb discusses "Julius Nyerere's African socialist project" (42)
            in Tanzania. He admits that after a dozen years of socialist rule,
            the country saw "continuing poverty, inequality, malnutrition, and
            lack of education" (43). But he does not examine what happened
            <i>after</i> Tanzania abandoned socialism, which is described in an
            IMF paper as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            "In 1985, Tanzania was in severe economic distress, plagued by
            widespread shortages and high inflation. Agricultural production,
            the mainstay of the economy, had been declining steadily...
            Exports of cash crops... had fallen by half between 1970
            and 1985. A foreign exchange shortage led to a precipitous drop in
            imports, which in turn caused a crisis in the manufacturing
            sector...
        </p>

        <p>
            "Twenty years later, Tanzania looks radically different. Inflation
            has declined to single digits... Economic growth is
            buoyant, averaging 7 percent a year since 2000. Real per capita
            income has risen by 50 percent..."
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, the above is from the IMF, and perhaps it is all just
            capitalist propaganda. Nevertheless, there are similar reports from
            many countries around the world, and it would have been salutary
            for Lamb to have addressed the argument running, "Sure, you
            socialists <i>claim</i> to want to help the poor, but, <i>in
            fact</i>, your preferred policies leave them poor, while
            market-friendly policies <i>actually</i> increase their standard of
            living." This argument might be incorrect, but certainly it is at
            least worthy of refutation in a book such as this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lamb, naturally enough, is anxious to disassociate the socialism he
            likes from National Socialism, or Nazism. And so he writes,
            “Nazism did not bring about anything like the combination of
            freedom and equality that lies at the core of socialism” (45). Neither,
            of course, have any of the regimes that Lamb does not think of as
            socialist “masquerades.” In fact, one of the most famous critiques
            of socialism, Hayek's <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>, makes the case
            that socialism is <i>inherently</i> incapable of bringing about the
            combination of freedom and equality to which socialists aspire.
            Again, it may be the case that Hayek is full of it and socialists
            can readily achieve their aims. Nevertheless, it is quite
            surprising that a book aiming to serve as a scholarly introduction
            to socialism barely mentions Hayek. Nor do we find Ludwig von
            Mises in the references (the book lacks an index), despite the fact
            that socialist Oskar Lange wrote, in his paper "On the Economic
            Theory of Socialism":
        </p>

        <p>
            "Socialists have certainly good reason to be grateful to Professor
            Mises... For it was his powerful challenge that forced the
            socialists to recognize the importance of an adequate system of
            economic accounting to guide the allocation of resources in a
            socialist economy... a statue of Professor Mises ought to occupy an
            honorable place in the great hall of the Ministry of Socialization
            or of the Central Planning Board of the socialist state." (1936)
        </p>

            Discussing Stalin, Lamb claims "Stalin ignored the human-made
            nature of economic laws, which thus cannot be objective" (59).
            Here, this reviewer must reluctantly side with Stalin. Marx
            himself, who was a quite competent student of Smith, Ricardo, and
            other classical economists, is no doubt turning over in his grave
            upon seeing Lamb's claim. After all, if "economic laws" are just
            "human-made," then what becomes of Marx's claim that economic
            systems must, of necessity, proceed from primitive communism,
            through slave-based societies, to feudalism, to capitalism, and
            then to socialism? If this progression is "human-made," rather than
            objective, then perhaps feudalism could be what's coming next? Marx
            himself, in <i>Capital</i>, sought "to lay bare the economic
            law of motion of modern society" (Marx, 1867). But if this "law" was
            something merely made up by Marx, what in the world would have been
            the point of trying "to lay [it] bare"? Indeed, in the very same
            introduction, Marx goes much further, and states that his system
            "is a question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies
            working with iron necessity towards inevitable results" (Marx,
            1867). Now, it is certainly possible that Marx was completely wrong
            about the "iron necessity" of economic laws, and that Lamb is
            correct in asserting that we humans simply make them up as we wish
            them to be. But if that is true, then Lamb ought to be honest and
            admit that <i>his</i> sort of socialism stands in stark
            contradiction to Marx's socialism, with it axiomatic dependency on
            the "inevitable results" of economic laws. Instead, Lamb repeatedly
            invokes the authority of Marx, while seemingly rejecting the most
            elementary aspects of Marx's system.
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary, Lamb's book is an excellent Primmer on what socialists
            think about socialism. While I think it would’ve been a much better
            book if you did also told us what non-socialists think about
            socialism, half the story well told is better then the whole story
            poorly told.
            If one wants a literature review of socialist works published over
            the last century or so, this book will be an excellent addition to
            one's library. But if you are looking for a dispassionate
            examination of the case for and against socialism, on either a
            theoretical or empirical basis, then, unfortunately, you must look
            elsewhere.
