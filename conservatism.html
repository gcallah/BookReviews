                In the time of Brexit, Trump, Viktor Orb√°n, the Polish Law and
                Justice party, and Jair Bolsonaro, the question of what,
                exactly, is conservatism has taken on a new urgency. Are these
                new political players dangerous reactionaries or
                a justified populist counterweight to out-of-touch elites?
                Are any of them even conservatives? (Many "mainstream
                conservative" institutions in the US and the UK reject all 
                or most of the above.) Given these circumstances, the 
                publication of these two books, especially the second of them,
                is timely.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us turn first to <i>Conservative Moments</i>. The
                book is a collection of twelve essays on various political
                philosophers and politicians who might be considered
                conservative, as well as four on entire geographical areas,
                e.g., "Conservatism in Europe." The figures covered range from
                Plato and Augustine to Reagan and Thatcher, and include 
                other notables such as David Hume, Edmund Burke, Alexander
                Hamilton, Samuel Coleridge, Leo Strauss, and Michael Oakeshott.
                (A chapter on Joseph de Maistre would have been a welcome
                addition here.) How can such a diverse collection of thinkers
                and political actors be brought under a single umbrella
                named "conservative": to his credit, the editor of this volume,
                Mark Garnett, recognizes the difficulty of assembling such a
                crowd under one cover. He offers his own, 
            </p>

            <p>
                The editors of the series of which this book is a
                part describe it as follows:
                "'Textual Moments in the History of Political Thought'...
                is designed to encourage fresh readings of thematically selected
                texts. Each chapter identifies a key textual moment or passage
                and exposes it to a reading by an acknowledged expert" (x).
                Aside from the use of the word 'exposes,' which strikes me
                as a triumph of trendy jargon over clarity, I also wonder
                whether the brief space allocated to each "reading" is really
                sufficient to accomplish the goal of the series: the 
                six or seven pages allocated to each chapter hardly seems
                enough to convey a novel view of, say, Plato or Burke. What 
                the authors <i>are</i> generally able to accomplish is to give
                a brief summary of the sense in which a particular thinker
                may be regarded as conservative, and discuss to what extent
                such a label actually captures his thought. Now, that is
                a worthwhile achievement -- as my grandmother would have said,
                "that's nothing to sneeze at" -- but it falls short of the 
                grander goal of the series editors.

                Perhaps my least favorite of the essays in this volume was
                "Conservatism in Turkey." I came to it not entirely ignorant of
                the existence of Recip Tayyip Erdogan, but without any
                particular opinion as to whether he was a hero, a villain, or,
                like most politicians, something in between. I believe this
                ignorance stood me in good stead in evaluating this essay,
                since I had no pre-conceived position to defend, and hoped to
                increase my knowledge of Erdogan by reading it.
            </p>

            <p>
                But my hopes were dashed: all I really learned here was that
                this essay's three authors really, really dislike Erdogan. They
                dislike him so much, apparently, that they can't write
                coherently in discussing him. For instance, they contrast 
                Erdogan's supposed "liberal-conservatism" with the radical
                reform agenda of Ataturk. While Erdogan is currently popular in
                Turkey, the authors want to claim that Ataturk still has his
                adherents as well, and so they write: "The wheel has not turned
                a complete circle in Turkey, and Ataturk is still a respected
                figure" (104). But a wheel that turns "a complete circle" is
                right back where it started, and would mean that Ataturk was as
                respected as he was at his height of influence. They really
                mean something like, "But Turkish politics have not turned 180
                degrees..." Well, OK, they screwed up a geometrical metaphor.
                Is that so bad?
            </p>

            <p>
                No, but it is just a symptom, not the disease, which is that
                the authors antipathy to Erdogan clouds their ability to think.
                For instance, they write:
            </p>

            <blockquote> 
                It would be perverse... if the AKP [Erdogan's party] had
                claimed to be 'conservative' only as a tactical ploy to help it
                secure a position from which it could usher in an indefinite
                period of violent instability. (105)
            </blockquote> 

            <p>
                Here, the authors seem to be claiming that Erdogan's party
                pretended to want conservative stability but really were after
                "an indefinite period of violent instability." But that claim
                is absurd: what ruling party could possibly be hiding its
                desire for violent instability behind a ploy of wanting stable
                rule? I assume the authors had something else in mind here, but
                what that could be is beyond my ability to divine.
                But even worse, only two paragraphs later, the authors 
                indicate that "the AKP has discarded the de-contextualized
                'liberalism,' while retaining the 'consevative' principles"
                (105). I'm sorry, but I can't really understand how the AKP's
                conservatism was only a "ploy," but was, in fact, what it
                retained while abandoning its liberalism.

                Efraim Podolisk analyzes Oakeshott's earlier and later works in
                terms of the "pessimistic anti-rationalism" (71) of the early
                material versus the "liberal mood" (71) of the later works.

                Timothy J. Lombardo, the author of <i>Blue Collar
                Conservatism</i>, wants to dispute the image of working-class
                conservatives as simple racists. No, he insists, they are
                actually <i>complex</i> racists:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                ...the 1968 Kerner Commission Report... blamed white racism 
                for the urban uprisings that struck American cities in the
                mid-to-late 1960s... But the familiar backlash narrative is
                misleading and overly reductive... Parts of the backlash theory 
                certainly ring true, but they still must be understood in the
                context of the myriad changes wrought by the urban crisis. (6)
            </blockquote> 

            <p>
                Attempts to deny one's racism serve, for Lombardo, to confirm
                it. "Blue-collar whites <i>adopted</i> color-blind discourse"
                (10, emphasis mine), to hide the racist motivation behind their
                "rejection of racially inclusive housing, education, and
                employment policies" (11). Lombardo never asks whether policies
                like erecting giant public housing projects, busing kids miles
                from their homes for school, and affirmative action in the
                workplace could be rejected for some other reason than
                animosity towards "racial inclusion": no, these are apparently 
                good policies <i>a priori</i>, and any opposition to them is
                inherently racist. This assumption is especially extraordinary
                given that Jane Jacobs, over 50 years ago,
                offered a devastating critique of the harm done by public
                housing projects to the very people they were supposed to
                be helping. But for Lombardo, blue-collar whites supposed pride
                in their neighborhoods, traditions, and hard work was merely "a
                means of obfuscating race" (11). Even if working-class whites
                were, by some miracle, "genuinely color-blind," this "was a
                function of their white privilege" (11-12).

            <p>
                I came to this book as a Frank Rizzo <i>tabula rasa</i>, 
                having been too young and too removed from Philadelphia politics
                to have been aware of him as the city's mayor in the 1970s,
                and having read nothing about him since. So I approached this
                work as a piece of serious research that would fill that
                lacuna. So I was surprised to find the author writing,
                in the introduction:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                To his critics, Rizo was little more than a villain. They saw
                him as an enemy of civil rights, a bully, a racist, a sexist,
                a homophobe, and a mean-spirited patriarchical figurehead of a
                regressive political order. He was all those things. (p. 3)
            </blockquote> 

            <p>
                So, not knowing anything about Rizzo, I was in no position to
                evaluate if any of these accusations were true. No, what
                surprised me was to find this in the <i>introduction</i>
                to the book: Shouldn't the confirmation of these accusations 
                have been in the book's <i>conclusion</i>, rather than in its
                introduction? Ought not an honest, scholarly examination of
                Rizzo's career begun by asking, say, "Was he all those things?"
                rather than positing that he was, without further ado?
                And just to be clear, I am not denying that perhaps Rizzo
                <i>was</i> a bully, racist, sexist, homophobe, etc.: it is just
                that, if I am to conclude that he was, I would like to do so
                after the presentation of the case for these criticisms, rather
                than taking them as assumptions at the start of the
                "anti-Rizzo" case.
            </p>

            <p>
                There certainly is evidence of racism, for instance, in the
                treatment of the X family, the first black family to move into
                neighborhood Y
                Self-undermining!
