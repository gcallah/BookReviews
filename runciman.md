Gray: "For Hobbes humans are like machines, in that their behavior is covered by the laws of nature." (10)


In his chapter on Arendt, Runciman comments upon her claim, "All that the giant computers proves that the modern age was
wrong to believe with Hobbes that rationality, in the sense of 'reckoning with consequences' is the highest and most human
of man's capacities." Runciman goes on to say, "The word that stands out for me in that sentence is not 'Hobbes'; it is
'giant'... She saw computers, dominating human beings by scale, not just by scale of processing speed: this was almost
by physical scale..." (193-194).

This is an absurd interpretation of Arendt's claim: She is clearly concerned with the "reckoning" power of computers.
The fact that this increased, at that time, with their visible signs, is a trivial and contingent aspect of the point
she is making it is hard to imagine why that particular word "stood out" for Runciman.
