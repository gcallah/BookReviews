In an age which glorifies leaping past all barriers, David McPherson has written an argument
for the importance of "recognizing proper limits in
human life." He focuses on the "limiting virtues" of "humility, reverence, moderation, contentment, neighborliness, and
loyalty." He discusses these virtues in relation to four kinds of limits: "(1) existential limits; (2) moral limits; (3)
political limits; and (4) economic limits." (1) McPherson calls the approach to life that acknowledges such limits as the
"accepting-appreciating stance," and that which seeks to overcome limits the "choosing-controlling stance." Throughout
the book, he stresses that both stances are essential aspects of human life, but that the accepting-appreciating stance
should be our default attitude. Making the choosing-controlling stance primary drains life of meaning, since the world
is seen as a collection of problems to be solved, the solving of which, in the absence of acceptance and appreciation,
soon enough appears pointless: McPherson contends that the dominance of the choosing-controlling stance leads to nihilism.

## Existential Limits

McPherson begins his anaylsis of existential virtues by arguing
that the master limiting virtue is humility, because it reins in our tendency to "play God," a tendency McPherson also
calls "the Promethean spirit." As one prominent example of that spirit, McPherson cites Nietzsche's murder of God, leaving
us in a situation in which "we must play God," and transcend humanity by becoming "ubermensch." Many of Nietzsche's epigones
today call themselves "transhumanists," and hope to leave behind the human condition not, like Nietzsche, through the
will, but largely through medical and technological sorcery.

McPherson then rejects notable legal theorist Ronald Dworkin's embrace of genetic engineering, because it treats children as
manufactured products from which all defects are to be removed, rather than as gifts to be accepted.

Given the many quotes from G.K. Chesterton in this book, 
McPherson is clearly an admirer; here he quotes him on the foolishness of piling up more and more stuff without
appreciating what one already has: "there is no sense in not appreciating things; and there is no sense in having more
of them if you have less appreciation of them."

The ultimate rejection of the accepting-appreciating stance is suicide, and McPherson again turns to Chesterton for
insight on that act:

"Not only is suicide, a sin, it is the sin. It is the ultimate and absolute evil.. the refusal to take the oath of
loyalty to life. The man who kills a man, kills a man. The man who kills himself, kills all men; as far as he's
concerned, he wipes out the world..."

McPherson does not mention euthanasia, but the implication of the above should be clear: Assisting someone in committing
"the ultimate and absolute evil" should not be condoned by our legal system.

## Moral Limits

McPherson next turns to morality. (As he notes, in a way his entire book is about morality, but here he means
morality as it is typically and more narrowly discussed by moral philosophers.)

His first topic is character formation, about which he adopts an Aristotelean position, where good character is formed by
inculcating good habits, which necessarily involves restrictions and prohibitions. Oddly, the Ten Commandments don't
appear here (they only come on stage at the very end of the book), but they are a obvious and famous example of the value
of prohibitions.

But why should we respect the restrictions that traditional morality puts on us? McPherson's answer is "reverence": a proper
sense of reverence for the gift of the world will render these prohibitions not arbitrary but flowing from the very
nature of our being. Interestingly, McPherson relies heavily on the Confucian tradition when he wants to discuss the
virtue of reverence.  (A worthwhile move, I think, as it demonstrates that the idea of virtue inherently
involving limits is not some "Eurocentric" notion.) McPherson examines several other avenues that have been travelled in
justifying absolute prohibitions, such as Stuart Hampshire's argument that they are necessary to avoid "moral anarchy," and
finds them wanting.

McPherson goes on to make a good case for manners as a way of showing proper reverence and disciplining our animal appetites.
For example, basic table manners are a way of taming and controlling our animal appetite for food and humanizing it.
Animals simply gobble down the food available to them as fast and efficiently as possible, but all human cultures place
restraints on such behavior, helping us to control our animal appetites. Similarly, when it comes to sex,
we ought to transform lust into romantic love.

McPherson next turns to the proper role of partiality in the moral life.  Those entranced with rationalist moral
theories often reject the idea that we should view our own children, or our next-door neighbor, with any higher
regard than a person in need, whom we have never met, on the other side of the world: such attachment to our own is
"irrational," they contend. John Stuart Mill and Peter Singer are cited as prominent examples of this view.
McPherson does an excellent job of destroying such nonsense: abjuring special concern for
one's own family, friends, and neighbors in favor of "humanity" is typically a mask hiding the fact that the person
recommending it really doesn't care for anyone else at all. The people embracing this view love "humanity in general,"
an abstraction that has no annoying personalty traits, as a way of excusing their lack of love for the frustratingly
complex people that actually surround them in their lives. McPherson quotes Aristotle on this point: "Those who are
many-friended, and treat everyone they meet as if they were their own kin, seem to be friends with no one."

In the last part of this chapter, McPherson discusses the virtue of loyalty and how it relates to our duty to assist those in
dire need. He makes the excellent observation the parable of the Good Samaritan does not, in fact, suggest we have the
same duties to distant people we know little about as to those we meet in person: the Good Samaritan was not sending his
denarii to a relief fund to aid victims of an earthquake in Bactria, but was donating them to help a man whom he had
directly encountered. It is very easy to adopt a high-minded desire to help "humanity," but much more difficult (and
useful) to actually engage in helping the people we personally encounter.

While I do think McPherson is largely correct here, I wonder if he gives quite enough weight to the limits on loyalty.
He considers a case where a son turns in his father for stealing a sheep, and Confucius condemns the son.
Perhaps sheep stealing is not a serious enough crime to justify overturning filial bonds, but what about rape, or
murder? Surely one's father could do something so heinous that one would have no moral choice but to turn him in?

## Political Limits

In the political realm, the question of limits concerns the proper or most useful scope of our political action. Is
there any justification for regarding the nation-state as a relevant entity in our evaluation of what actions are
virtuous? Shouldn't we instead aspire to perfect, global governance?  And are there any reasonable limits on with sort
of improvements to the human condition we can hope to achieve through politics?

In regards to the first two questions, McPherson examines the case that Martha Nussbaum makes for becoming a "citizen of the
world," rather than of any particular, local polity. While she dismisses attachments to our local political society as
displaying ugly "us versus them thinking," McPherson responds that her cosmopolitanism is, in fact,
a *form* of us versus them thinking, allowing cosmopolitans like her to look down upon patriotic rubes attached to their
own nation. In fact, as McPherson notes, proper loyalty to one's own polity, can, in fact, yield a genuinely cosmopolitan outlook, since it
involves realizing that other people, in other polities, are similarly attached to their own country.

McPherson goes on to consider some radically egalitarian approaches to political morality, in particular, those of John Rawls
and G.A. Cohen. As he sees it, Rawls and Cohen, in declaring a person's natural endowment and circumstances of birth and
upbringing as "arbitrary from a moral point of view," are guilty of a lack of reverence for the world, and our
circumstances in it as given to us. They are waging "a metaphysical crusade against contingency," McPherson argues (quoting
David Wiggins). This is a very important point, as it undermines Rawls' claim that his political principles are
neutral between different comprehensive conceptions of the good life: in fact, they are dismissive of a conception of
the good life based on such nostrums as "we should count our blessings and not be envious of others."
And McPherson notes that another egalitarian, Ronald Dworkin, has actually elevated envy, traditionally counted as a vice,
into a "standard of justice." 

Cohen argues that the infeasibility of socialism is no reason to abandon it as an ideal: that is nonsense. A political
system that relies on reality being other than it is can be rejected for that reason alone. If only people were the size
of ants we could fit all living humans in Central Park and leave the rest of the earth as unidisturbed wilderness, but we
aren't that size, and there is no way to make us so. As McPherson puts it, "Utopianism wages war against the given world...
It is better to focus on realizing the good that is possible, and one of the most important reasons for objecting to
utopian thinking is that it is counterproductive to realizing this good."
McPherson argues that a "sufficientarian" approach to distributive justice, where it is a responsibility of the
political system to ensure everyone has "enough" for a decent life, is a realistic and worthy alternative to the
radical, utopian egalitarianism of someone like Cohen.

## Economic Limits

Finally, McPherson turns to economic limits. Here, he parts ways with almost every political figure in either party, in
rejecting the idea that limitless wealth for everyone is a sensible goal to strive for.
For both major U.S. political parties, the highest goal of government to deliver more and more
stuff to the people, and their major disagreement is about the best way to do so.
To the contrary, as McPherson puts it, "endless economic growth... is senseless without knowing what it is *for*." 

Of course, both our right-liberal and left-liberal political pundits will tell us that liberalism certainly does not
*entail* consumerism: under liberalism, they say, people are free to choose whatever sort of values they want, and if they
prefer an Amish or monastic lifestyle, well, they can have it. But, as McPherson correctly notes, that very attitude,
promoting *choice* as the ultimate value, is itself a comprehensive view: "however, liberalism is in fact, not really
neutral, since it ends up endorsing a particular conception of the good life, namely, the life of the choosing,
preference-satisfying self which is not 'encumbered' by any strong social ties, and an objective conception of the good
life." 

McPherson does a good job debunking the libertarian case for unlimited wealth acquisition, which he finds exemplified in
the work of Jason Brennan. Brennan endorses the unlimited acquisition of wealth for enabling us to get what we want,
while ignoring the fact that living a good life is much more about learning to want the right things. 

McPherson counters Brennan with the wisodom of Jesus we find in the gospels, for instance, noting the tragedy of the man who
could not surrender his attachment to his worldly goods in order to find true fulfillment. As McPherson puts it:

"Precisely because of how greater wealth enables us to get more of what we want... it gives more free rein to our
desires, and can encourage their multiplication in a way that is unconnected with living a good life, and thus it can
lead ... to our being enslaved to our insatiable desires."

Unlike some critics of *homo economicus*, McPherson correctly understands that the rational choice model of human
behavior does not exclude ethical preferences. But, he argues, that model "distorts the nature of
ethical reasons which recognize normative standards... for what we ought to desire, and so [they]
should not be regarded as mere preferences among other preferences." In lieu of that model, he
offers the work of Wendell Berry and Catholic Social Teaching as offering better guides to the role of economic activity
in human life.


McPherson closes his book with a meditation on the importance of "keeping the Sabbath," whether one is Jewish, or Christian, or
neither. The idea of a day where we refrain from working, and instead contemplate the life we have worked for and the
world as given to us, is, for McPherson, a day devoted to the importance of the accepting-appreciating stance.

He claims that "even if one is not a theist, one can recognize the importance of the harmony that is sought here."
But is that really true? Granted, some views of the sacred typically regarded as "non-theistic," such as Buddhism and
Taoism, can recognize the importance of this sought-for harmony. However, I doubt such recognition is really available
to today's hard-core atheistic materialist.

## Conclusion

One curious absence in the book is any discussion of transgenderism: rejection of ones given sex and the employment of
unnecessary drugs and mutilating surgery in order to become more like the opposite sex is about a radical rejection of
the "accepting-appreciating stance" as is possible, but McPherson never mentions it. But perhaps he was wise to avoid
doing so, since touching on such a divisive topic might have distracted from his overall thesis.

I also think that McPherson's work could usefully employ the ideas of Iain McGilchrist on the differences
between right-hemisphere and left-hemisphere thinking, which map quite nicely onto McPherson's differentiation of the
appreciative view and the controlling view.

But these are very minor quibbles: this is an excellent book, both clear and concise. It is not overburdened with references, but
engages sufficiently with the relevant literature that an interested reader can explore further. And at a time when so
much of our culture regards any limits as abhorrent, and keeps telling us that we can "have it all," it is also a very
timely work.
