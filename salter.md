Alexander Salter has written an important book, examining how the political program of distributism can inform
contemporary debates about political economy. The fact that Salter is a trained economist with a PhD is significant,
since it contradicts the idea that taking distributism seriously might be simply a symptom of ignorance of
"scientific" economics. (Disclosure: Salter and I co-wrote a paper on distributism, which is, in fact, cited in
the book under review.) Despite Salter's sympathy with distributist thought, he never gives the architects of
distributism (chiefly G.K.  Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc) a free pass: he continually tests whether their ideas appear
plausible given commonly accepted economic theory. Spoiler: in many cases they do appear so, but in several others
Salter judges them to come up short.

Salter sets the scene for the core of his book with two chapters, the first on "common-good capitalism." That was the
theme of a speech by Senator Marco Rubio, in which Rubio claimed that, despite "years of robust economic growth, we still
have millions of people unable to find dignified work, and feeling forgotten, ignored, and left behind" (quoted
in Salter, pg. 1). After rejecting socialism as an answer to our problems, Rubio argued that the right response "is not
to abolish free enterprise but to moralize it" (2). And Salter points out that Rubio has hardly been alone among figures
broadly "on the right" who recently have been questioning laissez-faire ideology, noting a manifesto published in
*First Things* signed by "more than a dozen high-profile academics and public intellectuals" (3). Salter goes on to
discuss Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen and Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule as prominent examples of
intellectuals promoting a revived concern for the common good as necessary to cure what ails us, and notes that each of
them grounds his critique of the current order in Catholic social teaching. To close out the chapter, Salter points
out that "common-good capitalism" is not an example of a "third-way" economic system halfway between socialism and
capitalism. The common "third way" is the regulatory-redistrbutivist state, which, given its focus on "material comfort
and social pacification," is focused on "second-order problems," and thus ignores the first-order problem of "respecting
human dignity" (7). In particular, third-way solutions, such as social democracy, relying on distributing either
consumer goods directly (such as food stamps or housing vouchers) or indirectly via cash transfers, to those less well
off, as if upping their level of consumption alone could make their lives satisfying. Distributism, on the other hand,
focuses on individual ownership of *productive* property, which enables each individual to have the
dignity of more greatly directing their own life as they see fit.

In the next chapter, Salter offers a brief out line of Catholic social thought. The Church had always been engaged with
social issues, but the impetus for articulating a specifically Catholic approach to social issues was "the economic and
political upheavals in the West following the Industrial Revolution" (15). The foundational documents in this effort
were Pope Leo XIII's *Rerum Novarum* of 1891 and Pope Pius XI's *Quadragesimo Anno* of 1931.

In this chapter, Salter claims that "Industrialization greatly increased living standards..." (17). But recent research has shown that
in the nineteenth century the physical health of the rural populations of Scotland and Ireland was much better than that
of industrialized England. Unfortunately, Salter does not consider the impact of forced enclosures of common land,
cutting peasants off from an important source of their livelihood, on the mass movement of peasants into factory work.
He claims that "Many voluntarily left the countryside in pursuit of wage employment in cities..." (17), but this is
somewhat like saying that "I voluntarily moved into a homeless shelter, after my house was demolished by legislative
act."

In any case, the various pronouncements of the Catholic Church during this period asserted that, contra socialists,
private property is vital to human flourishing, but, contra economic liberals, property rights are not absolute: "The
state must regulate ownership and its attendant privileges in the interests of the common good" (18). Pope Pius added
the vital concept of *subsidiarity* to Leo's work: "higher-order communities [such as nations]...[must not] interfere
with the operation of lower-order communities [such as a village} without just cause" (18).



Salter begins his foray into the particulars of distributist thought with two chapters on the English writer Hilaire
Belloc, the first addressing his work, *The Servile State*.


"Man needs not just a shelter but a *home*, and socialism cannot distinguish between the two." (92)


Chesterton sees the battle between Tories and socialists as little more than a pantomime, disguising the awful
possibility that they are "secretly in partnership; the quarrel they keep up in public is very much of a put-up job; and
that the way in which they perpetually play into each other's hands is not an everlasting coincidence (92-93)

"It never seems to strike these people, that the lesson of lice in the slums is the wrongness of slums, not the
wrongness of hair." (93)


Salter spends some time discussing Mary Hirschfeld's work *Aquinas and the Market*. Hirschfeld notes that while economics
discusses efficiency, in terms of what means are employed to achieve any ends whatsoever, Aquinas holds that "human choice
is not about efficiently getting what we want so much as it is about learning how to want what is genuinely good" (144,
Salter quoting Hirshfeld). There is no virtue in being very efficient about achieving evil ends. Salter contends that
while Hirshfeld's work points us towards a humane *economics*, Belloc and Chesterton's program is about creating a
humane *economy*. Thus, Salter concludes, these are two complementary research programs that should be united.


Where can the minimum wage be set so that it is correct for a parent supporting several children, one member of a couple
going back to work part time while the other is working full-time, a single person living on their own, a teenager
living at home with his parents, and someone with some other means of support who is trying to get going in some highly
desirable line of work. (for instance, a band starting out may be willing to play a good location for free, in order to
gain fans, but that rate of pay is certainly below any possible minimum wage.) Belloc, Chesterton and Röpke would all
agree that, better than trying to artificially prop up the wage of a proletarian worker, let's de-proletarianize him.
(And, by the way, so would Marx and Engels, who disdained things like minimum wage legislation.)

The economic incidence of a tax 

Our workers really "paid their marginal product"? When it comes to individual brokers, the idea is preposterous: I have
worked with many companies I'm not a single one of them ever had any idea what the "marginal product" of any individual
worker was. When it comes to different categories of work, or as a whole, it would be true that they would get paid
their marginal product in Mises "imaginary construction of the evenly rotating economy": but Mises was quite clear that
this is an *imaginary* construction. So even setting aside, political interventions and power dynamics, there is still
room for Chesterton's‘s argument to have validity. 


A key figure for Salter is the German economist Wilhelm Röpke, who married Belloc and Chesterton's concerns about
proletariazation and the inhuman scale of modern life with a rigorous knowledge of economic price theory. Salter devotes
two chapters to Röpke, the first to show that his social concerns are remarkably similar to those of Bellow and
Chesterton (both of whom Röpke cites), and the second to demonstrate his grasp of economic theory and its importance to
his recommendations for reform.




As someone who has repeatedly committed the venial sin of reviewing academic books, I find too many academic writers
seem to believe that the best way of showing one's intelligence is to write obscurely. Salter does not suffer from that
illusion: his writing is always pellucid. A minor quibble: Salter does employ the contemporary, nearly instinctual habit
of announcing in advance or retrospectively repeating one's main argument. At one point he writes, "It will be helpful
to summarize the arguments thus far" (127). My reaction was, "Not really: I have been following along." I cannot recall
a single classic work of philosophy, social theory, or history that follows this method: I think it is a journalistic
trick appropriate for casual readers of newspapers that has unfortunately leaked into academic writing.


If I might be so bold as to try to capture the "main message" of Salters book, it might be that:

1. Those who attempt social reform without understanding price theory are likely to make foolish mistakes that result in
   the opposite effect of what they wished to achieve.
2. Those who rely only on price theory in devising, social policy, are likely to make in human mistakes that ignore all
   the things about people and their common life that cannot be captured in a supply-and-demand diagram.
