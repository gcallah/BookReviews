# Michael Oakeshott on the Human Condition
<br>

## Essays by Timothy Fuller
<br>

Timothy Fuller of Colorado State College is one of the worlds foremost scholars on the work of British philosopher
Michael Oakshott. Fuller was also a personal friend of Oakeshott's for the last 16 years of the latter's life, for a time
shared an office with him, and later took frequent
trips to England to converse with him. As such, this collection of Fuller's essays on Oakeshott is a welcome addition to
the ever increasing amount of secondary literature on the thinker.
<br>

This volume opens up with a charming reminiscence of Fuller's various encounters with Oakeshott, beginning
when, as a student in 1959, Fuller first read Oakeshott. He recalls Oakeshott "smoking continously" as he repeatedly
revised his papers for the History of Political Thought seminar, and how, after the seminar, they would go out to eat at
Luigi's or [Mon Plaisir](https://www.monplaisir.co.uk/about). When Fuller would visit Oakeshott ay his Dorset cottage he
was able to experience him driving his 1958 MG-B "at excessive speed through the hedgerows."
<br>

The first essay in the book is the first one Fuller wrote on Oakeshott, and is previously unpublished. In it, Fuller takes up
Oakeshott's concept of "modes" of experience, as described in Oakeshott's first book, *Experience and Its Modes*. In brief, a mode is
the whole of experience viewed from a partial, abstract perspective. For instance, science is the mode that views
experience through the lens of measurable quantity. Practice is the mode that understands experience as the continual attempt
to replace what-is with what-ought-to-be.
<br>

Now, every mode, but in particular science and practice, are prone to hubris, to assert that their partial take on the
world of experience is complete and all-encompassing.
Fuller writes that, "for the philosopher such a proclamation of
self-satisfaction [on the part of a mode] must be treated with skepticism." (4)
<br>

But treating a mode's claim to represent the whole of experience
with "skepticism" implies that such a view might be correct. But it seems to me that Oakeshott views them
as demonstrably mistaken: since the modes construct from the whole of experience "a restricted world of abstract ideas"
(EM 70), they are *necessarily* partial and defective. And Fuller seems to understand this quite well, as shown by the next few
pages of his essay. But that makes the choice of "skeptical" more puzzling, not less.
<br>

<br>

In an essay entitled "Authority in the Individual in Civil Association: Oakeshott, Flathman, Yves Simon," Fuller compares the
ideas of Oakeshott on the source of civil authority with those of American political scientist Richard Flathman and the French philosopher
Yves Simon. Fuller finds Oakeshott to occupy a middle ground on authority. On one side, he is flanked by Flathman's
"resolute irresolution" about using authority. Of Flathman, Fuller writes:
<br>

"Thus, like Locke, Flathman would have it two ways at once: the threat of the appeal to heaven [an appeal open to
anyone, who can reject the current authorities as "lacking the mandate of heaven"] will help keep the
authorities skittish about the exercise of authority, and most people will perhaps find it to their advantage to be
governed by those who are skittish about governing." 64
<br>

On Oakeshott's other side we find Yves Simon, who, working in the Thomistic natural law tradition, finds authority to be tasked
not merely with preserving civil order, but also with moving individuals towards their supreme good, as far as it is
possible to do so. And so Oakeshott winds up between them, not "skittish" about authority like Flathman, but also not assigning
it any role beyond keeping the peace.
<br>

<br>

The next essay is the text of the eulogy that Fuller delivered at the LSE memorial service following Oakeshott's
passing. In it, among other things, we learn of Oakeshott's love for the American West,
his non-utilitarian understanding of the purpose of higher education, and his profound influence on his students,
On the latter point, Fuller writes, "I have not personally known anyone who could feel the beauty of youth more
intensely, even at the end of his days, then Michael."
<br>

The chapter entitled "Michael Oakeshott's Political Thought" intriguingly begins with an extended discussion of his
religious thought. This is an aspect of Oakeshott's interests that, after the early 1930s, he was "reticent" to discuss,
but Fuller tells us that his study of theology was a lifelong pursuit. Fuller notes that "[Oakeshott] thought that St.
Augustine enjoyed the greatest religious imagination within our tradition and after him Pascal" 83.
<br>

In "The Poetics of Civil Life," Fuller claims, "Oakeshott was not urging us to be conservative â€“ he was arguing that we
could not help but be so. To deny this is not only to disguise the truth about ourselves, but also to lead us into
ill-considered projects for transforming the human race."
104
<br>

But to embark upon "ill-considered projects for transforming the human race" would seem to me to be the very paradigm of
being "not conservative."
<br>

He goes on to say, of Oakeshott's concept of civil association:
<br>

"The civil association requires someone to occupy an office of authority that is acknowledged as the source of
authoritative pronouncements... the occupant of an office like this is not privileged with special insight or knowledge..."
106
<br>

This is Oakeshott's [and Fuller's, and my] answer to the anarchist argument that any justification for the
existence of government relies on the assertion that government officials are qualitatively better than the
rest of us when it comes to making practical decisions about social matters. But that is nonsense: The justification for
having an umpire in a baseball game is not that the umpire understands baseball better than the players, or that he is
infallible or even better than the players at determining what is a ball and what is a strike, but merely that it is
desirable to have someone whose pronouncements on the matter are authoritative and final. Both the pitcher and the
batter may, in general, be better judges of what is a ball and what is a strike than the umpire. But clearly, given that
they are not disinterested parties about the distinction, they will often disagree. And then there must be someone
possessed of an office with the authority to decide "ball or strike," or the game cannot proceed. (Oakeshott notes that
the laws of civil association "are not the rules of a game," but that does not mean they do not bear many similarities
to the rules of a game.) Furthermore, there must be a way to decide where the strike zone is, is there such a thing as
an "infield fly rule," and when does it apply? Such decisions quite obviously cannot occur without an entity authorized
to make them.
<br>

Speaking of the world of practice, Fuller writes "So far, no 'what is' has ever ended challenges from further thoughts
of what ought to be" 141. Well, that is true, it seems off from Oakeshott's main point, which is that such a happening would
dissolve the practical mode, since it's primary presupposition is that the existing world is in some sense
unsatisfactory, and requires practical action to render it more satisfactory. (On this point, Oakeshott is remarkably like
Ludwig von Mises, who noted that action requires "felt unease.") So long as there is a world of practice, it is not
merely that "not yet" have we ever found our current situation completely satisfactory, but with certainty we never
will. And Fuller follows up his statement with a quote from Oakeshott that makes exactly this point.
<br>

I have a similar puzzle about another proposition of Fuller's, to wit:
<br>

"So long as the future is an essential element in practical appraisal, coherence has to elude us." 162
<br>

Here, the "so long as" is what troubles me: it is not as if the future could cease to be an essential element in practical
appraisal. As mentioned above, the world of practice presupposes understanding experience as consisting of 
a somehow less-than-satisfactory current situation that ought to be replaced by a more satisfactory future situation.
Appraisal without an eye to the future is not something that might unexpectedly "crop up" in tomorrow's practical activity:
instead, it would mean we had left the world of practice behind.
<br>

<br>

In another chapter, Fuller takes John Stuart Mill to be a representative specimen of Oakeshott's ideal type of the
"politics of faith." Oakeshott, in contrast, recognizes the politics of faith as an enduring pole of modern European politics,
but is himself more inclined towards the "politics of skepticism." Oakeshott finds no foundation for the party of the
politics of faith's claims that history exhibits regular moral and political progress "apart from a strong commitment to
them among the intellectual elite."
<br>

<br>

In an essay on historicism, Fuller finds Oakeshott, along with Hans-Georg Gadamer, to occupy a salutory middle ground
between R.G.  Collingwood's embrace of historicism and Leo Strauss's complete rejection of it. As Fuller quite sagely
points out, if Collingwood is claiming to "re-enact" the thought of, say, Plato, while also rejecting any
supra-historical truths, he is certainly not re-enacting Plato's claim to have actually experienced a transcendent
reality. On the other hand, the variety of historicism Strauss focuses his attacks upon, is, per Gadamer "naive
historicism": we can accept the existence of transcendental truths, while at the same time recognizing that our
necessarily limited understanding of such truths is historically conditioned.
<br>

<br>

In "Taking  Natural Law Seriously," Fuller examines Ronald Dworkin's book, *Taking Rights Seriously*, and concludes that
the eminent legal theorist "would appear... to be intent upon transforming the commitment to the rule of law into a
commitment to social engineering." 251 
<br>

For Oakeshott, in contrast, a judicial authority, under the rule of law, cannot "regard itself as the custodian of a public
policy or interest in favor of which... to resolve this disputed obligation." 260
<br>

Fuller contrasts both Dworkin and Oakeshott with natural law theorist John Finnis, who "seeks to pass between the normative
speculations of... utilitarian theorists, and the stark procedure of the pure rule of law."
<br>

Along the way, he provides this excellent quote from Finnis as to why utilitarians cannot do the calculations they pretend are behind their ethics:
<br>

"the [utilitarian's] imaginary perspective, as a God-like figure surveying possible worlds and choosing the world that
embodies greater good or lesser evil, is a perspective that is simply not open to human practical reason." â€” John
Finnis, Fundamentals of Ethics
<br>

An unfortunate aspect of these essays is that many of them are intended as introductions to the thought of Oakeshott,
and thus there is a high degree of repetitiveness in them. For instance, the story of the Chinese wheelwright skeptical
of book learning is told no fewer than three times, and the notable Oakeshott quote on politics being the "pursuit of
intimations" is also repeated as often. To re-use such illuminating passages in essays published years apart in different
outlets is understandable, but a little judicious editing might have relieved some of the repetition
once these essays were collected together.
<br>

Despite this flaw, this collection of essays is an excellent introduction to Oakeshott for the newcomer. Those
more familiar with Oakeshott should still find it packed with insights into the thinker that will make reading it
worthwhile.

<br>

Franco and Orr can't both be correct, and one wishes Fuller had tried to adjudicate their dispute a little more
decisively. I suspect that he, like I, would come down on the side of Franco, and say that Orr simply misunderstood what
Oakeshott was up to.
<br>

Oakeshott explained right in the very book Orr objects to what he was up to: he was "dropping anchor" with a certain set of
theoretical nets to see what fish could be caught at that location.
