## Installing Python

Very detailed tutorial for different ways to install python in different
operating system. Briefly but clearly states the benifit and limitation for
each way of installation. The author also offers detailed instrucitons for
installing pyenv using shell commands.

This book is friendly to the new python user, but the author does assume the
reader has fundemental shell and git knowledge. 

## Packaging

Even this book's topic is DevOps in Python, it's packaging chapters are worth
reading even for people don't have special interest in DevOps. It is very helpful
for setting up a valid, standard python envirenment for projects. It gives a
systemetic view and explanation on a lot of useful features like virtural
environment and Tox. As developers who have relied upon
web sites for much of our information, we think this book gave us a
better understanding of a lot of packages we have been using.

## Salt Stack

The author writes, "whenever a YAML file is used, `salt` will allow a Python file
that defines a dictionary." Does the author mean "whenever a YAML file is
*called for*, one may alternately use a Python file"? Perhaps... but then that
is what he ought to have written.
