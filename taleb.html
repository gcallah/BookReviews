        <h1>
            Getting Under Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Skin
        </h1>

        <p>
            Nassim Nicholas Taleb hates being called an "intellectual," so
            let's instead refer to him as a thinker, and go on to note
            that he is one of the more important thinkers of our time.
            That importance comes not so much from the volume of work he has
            produced, as from the fact that, with each new book, he
            gives his readers a significant and novel lens through which 
            one can look at the world. Furthermore, each book has grown out
            of the previous one, so that something mentioned briefly
            in one book would become the theme of the next one. And
            all of this work has been unified by the theme of 
            how to handle life in the face of "the dark forces
            of time and ignorance," is informed by a deep knowledge of probability
            and statistics, and is gleeful in its skewering of those
            who understand just enough about uncertainty to
            massively screw things up.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taleb made a significant amount of money as an option
            trader, and his experience dealing with risk in that 
            market has had a significant impact on his thought.
            After achieving financial independence through trading, he went
            on to earn a PhD from the University of Paris. He has since
            held a variety of academic posts, and published his first volume
            on uncertainty, <i>Fooled by Randomness</i>, in 2001.
            In <i>The Black Swan</i>, his most famous work
            (described as one of "Twelve Books That
            Helped Change the World" in the UK <i>Sunday Times</i>), Taleb
            highlighted how little we really can say about the "tails" of 
            probability distributions that we suppose we can model. The
            book has been credited with foreshadowing the financial crisis of
            2008. The importance of "tail risk" might be understood, in
            the context of that meltdown, as follows: the banks investing 
            in mortgages relied on models that assumed the risk of a
            nation-wide decline in housing prices in the US was 
            minute. But how "minute" is minute? Once in 100 years?
            Once in 1000 years? Once in 10,000 years? The banks chose the 
            "extremely unlikely" end of that spectrum, but they did so based 
            upon... only a few decades of data on the US housing market!
        </p>

        <p>
            "Anti-fragility" was a minor theme in <i>The Black Swan</i>,
            but it became the major one of his next full-length work
            (he released a book of aphorisms in between) <i>Antifragile: Things
            That Gain from Disorder</i>. This work introduced a whole new
            category into our thinking about the impact of randomness on
            entities in the world. Formerly, things were generally thought
            of as being robust -- able to withstand some random shocks --
            or fragile, and easily broken by such shocks. But <i>Antifragile</i>
            insisted on the need for a third category, the eponymous
            "antifragile," signifying things that become stronger
            when stressed. The concept caught on slowly at first,
            but is now finding applications in medicine, nutrition, exercise,
            finance, politics, physics, and information technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Antifragile</i> also introduces a story that is probably crucial
            to understanding Taleb's famously cantankerous public personality.
            (Full disclosure: Taleb is my colleague at the NYU Tandon School
            of Engineering, and in person, he is polite and friendly.)
            Taleb's great-grandfather was dying, and called his son
            (Taleb's grandfather) to his bedside.
            He let his son know how disappointed he was in the
            fact that no one was badmouthing him: that meant his son was too
            wimpy to be capable of generating envy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taleb has made sure he will never face such criticism himself:
            he takes glee in launching feuds with prominent intellectuals,
            such as Steven Pinker, Mary Beard, Cass Sunstein,
            or Paul Krugman, and, in fact,
            has coined a new term to describe such foes: IYIs, or
            "intellectuals yet idiots." Among the characteristics of IYIs is
            that they go on and on about their concern for the poor, but never
            hang out with those of lower social status; they praise "diversity"
            but have never gotten drunk with a minority cab driver or 
            spent time in a Jamaican nightclub; they are proud of their 
            braininess but have never read Michael Oakeshott or John Gray;
            they are self-proclaimed egalitarians
            but are obsessively concerned with
            their status in their university or their reviews in <i>The New
            York Times</i>. They place great faith in "statistical" studies
            without understanding anything about the foundations of statistics,
            and they follow the most-recent publicly promulgated dietary 
            guidelines without ever noticing that such guidelines continually
            contradict the set of guidelines issued just a year or two
            previously. They pretend to be good "Darwinists" while holding in
            contempt traditions that have survived for thousands of years.
            But, perhaps most importantly, they don't lift barbells in the
            gym, instead spending time on fancy treadmills and
            hyper-specialized weight machines. (I joke with "most importantly,"
            but Taleb himself does point to exercise choice as an important
            indicator of an IYI.)

            His new book, <i>Skin in the Game</i> (dedicated to Ron Paul
            and Ralph Nader), extends observations made
            about asymmetrical risk in <i>Antifragile</i> into a thesis about
            how human institutions "learn" over time. In addition, the book 
            analyzes large swaths of ethics as concerned with unequal
            distributions of "skin in the game."
        </p>

        <p>
            He begins by discussing Antaeus, the mythical son of Mother Earth
            and Poseidon: he was unbeatable in a fight, at least so long as he 
            could kep contact with the ground: his mother! But Hercules was
            able to defeat him by lifting him in the air and crushing him:
            this is a lesson to "keep our feet on the ground," i.e., to keep
            in contact with the practical world, and not fly off into
            an abstract heaven of theorizing disconnected from reality.
            But modernity is plagued by abstract theorizers lacking all
            practical experience; as Taleb puts it, 
            "The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a
            class of people who are better at explaining than understanding"
            (14).
        </p>

        <p>
            He immediately extends this trope to modern Libya.
            Here he goes after the "interventionistas"
            (foreign policy theorists with no "skin
            in the game,") who have repeatedly urged us to intervene 
            in foreign countries -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria -- whose
            governments did not meet the interventionistas
            abstract standards for political acceptability. Each of those
            interventions made life for the average person in the country being
            "saved" significantly worse -- and yet the interventionistas pay
            no price whatsoever for wrecking the lives of millions, but
            instead keep appearing on CNN and PBS as "experts" who should
            be guiding the rest of us as to what country we ought to bomb
            next. Taleb contrasts the interventionistas lack of skin in the
            game with rulers in the ancient world, who would often 
            appear at the front in any wars they undertook: he cites the
            Roman emperor Julian the Apostate, who died with a Persian
            spear in his chest.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taleb next describes the "Bob Rubin trade": Robert Rubin, 
            who was Treasury Secretary under the Clintons, returned to
            the "private sector" at Citigroup, from whom he
            received $120 million in compensation in the decade after his
            leaving "public service." However, when the house of cards,
            which his advice helped to construct, collapsed in 2008, he
            suffered no consequences for his role in the meltdown.
            Instead, it was hard-working plumbers and crab fishermen and
            farmers and Spanish grammar specialists who paid the price in the
            form of trillion-dollar, taxpayer-funded bailouts of insolvent banks.
            And note: Rubin is merely a synechdoche for
            "banking professionals" in general here: in that the government
            will decide that certain banks are "too big to fail," it will 
            permit employees of those banks to take extraordinary risks
            for extraordinary short-term profits, as those bankers know they 
            will suffer little-to-no consequence should their actions
            ultimately result in catastrophic losses.
            If I can collect $5 million bonuses for seven years,
            what do I care if in year eight every investment
            I sold my clients loses 90% of its value?
        </p>

        <p>
            And the idea we can "regulate" our worries away, is, as Taleb
            notes, nonsense:
            "The move [towards hedge funds]
            took place mostly because of the overbureaucratization of
            the system as paper shufflers (who think work is mostly about paper
            shuffling) overburdened the banks with rules -- but somehow, in the
            thousands of pages of additional regulations, <i>they avoided
            considering skin in the game</i>." In other words, rather than
            simply making bankers personally responsible for the meltdowns
            they create, by, for example, fining Bob Rubin $115 million
            for his role in the 2008 financial crisis, the IYIs instead 
            devise a new, bizarrely complex set of financial "regulations,"
            that, they assure us, will mean that "this can never happen
            again," but which will instead simply allow a new Bob Rubin,
            trained at his Ivy League school to master such bureaucratese,
            to game the system anew.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Skin in the game" applies to ethics through the idea of
            symmetrical risk: don't put <i>someone else's</i> skin in the game
            without putting your own in as well. Taleb shows the idea is at
            least as old as the Code of Hammurabi, which declared that if a
            builder constructed a house that collapsed and killed the occupant,
            the builder should be put to death. The "eye-for-an-eye" principle
            behind Hammurabi's code does not, he assures us, need to be taken
            completely literally: we don't actually need to cut off the leg
            of the surgeon who accidentally cut off the wrong leg in an
            amputation: it is probably enough to "cut off" his golf club
            membership with a large lawsuit settlement, so that not only the
            patient is at risk during the operation.
        </p>

        <p>
            In an interesting application of the idea of "skin in the game,"
            Taleb explains how an intransigent minority with a lot
            invested in  some topic can impose its views on
            a much larger populace that is relatively indifferent on the
            topic. For instance, despite perhaps 90% of a populace not
            caring about eating GMO foods, the 10% who object to them
            might make their sale unviable: if even one person out of ten at a
            party refused to eat GMO foods, it is much simpler to just order 
            100%-non-GMO foods, than it is to worry about keeping two
            separate food tables, especially since people who 
            aren't concerned about GMOs will still happily eat non-GMO
            foods. Taleb uses this principle to explain why most soft drinks are
            kosher, despite only a couple percent of the population caring
            about whether their soda has a kosher label: since it costs little
            more to make kosher drinks than non-kosher ones, it is simpler
            just to make all drinks kosher than it is to produce and distribute
            two sets of beverages.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "Lindy effect" gets its own chapter in the new book. This 
            principle gets its name from the story of actors meeting at Lindy,
            a New York City deli that boasts of its famous cheesecake. Those
            actors, speculating on how long a run some Broadway show would
            have, made the observation that the best predictor of a show's
            <i>future</i> run was how long it had <i>already</i> run.
            If a show had been running for three days, one's best bet would be
            that it would run another three days. And if it had run for 30
            years, the best bet is it would run for another 30.
            This principle, Taleb contends, applies to social institutions
            and practices in general: if, for instance, the Buddhism has
            lasted 2500 years, our best bet for how much longer it will be
            around is "another 2500 years." Meanwhile, the current progressive
            obsession with identity politics, having
            been around for 10 or 15 years, 
            will most likely disappear in another decade or two.
            It is <i>time</i>, and not the opinion of "experts," that is the
            ultimate judge of the value of social practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the topic of religion, Taleb contends that
            we know far too little to actually determine the "rationality"
            of some belief; instead, we need to look at the effect beliefs have
            on the believers' behavior, and on their society as a whole:
            "There is no such thing as the 'rationality' of a belief, there is
            rationality of action" (220).
            This approach, I think, is a shortcoming in Taleb's work:
            while he defends traditional religions, he does so based solely 
            on the beneficial <i>practical</i> effects of the beliefs they
            promulgate. The idea that there might be something transcendental
            at the core of some religion, something worth respecting
            <i>even if</i> the practical effects of doing so might prove
            disastrous, does not seem to be of concern to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even Christology is examined 
            in light of the book's overarching theme, and
            Taleb finds that the Church Fathers were wise: Christ <i>had</i>
            to be fully human, or he wouldn't have had "skin in the game":
            a divine figure just playing at being human, a la Zeus
            or visiting angel, isn't really risking anything.
        </p>

        <p>
            The conclusion of the book addresses the issue of why "ensemble
            risk" can be treated the same as "time risk." The difference
            can be understood by considering a game of Russian roulette
            with a bullet in one of six chambers. The rules are that if the
            "house" pulls the trigger and you live, you get a million dollars.
            If 100 people play, we can say that the expected payoff 
            for each is $833,333.33. But we can't say that the expected payoff
            for a single person playing 100 times is $83,333,333.33! Instead,
            we expect, with near certainty, that he will be dead. And if he
            dies on the second trigger pull, he does not get to play the other
            98 times. This demonstrates why an individual cannot expect to get
            the "average" return from the market: at some point, he will lose
            enough that he will "cry uncle" and leave the market. Taleb
            contends that social scientists repeatedly mistake ensemble risk
            and time risk, leading to, for instance, their condemnation of risk
            aversion as "irrational."
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have enjoyed Taleb's previous books, this one will not
            disappoint you. And if you are unfamiliar with his work, then
            <i>Skin in the Game</i> will be a great place to remedy that
            problem.
