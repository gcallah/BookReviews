                     Against the Grain:
                     A Deep History of the Earliest States
                </i>
                James C. Scott,
                Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2017
            </h3>

            <p>
                James C. Scott gave two lectures at Harvard in 2011 on
                plant and animal domestication and the earliest states. But the
                discussion afterwards, by a panel of experts, convinced him that his
                arguments "were not remotely ready for prime time" (x). So he
                plunged into five years of research on these topics, and the
                result is this work under review.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scott's central aim is to examine to what extent "settling
                down" to fixed-field farming, and the rise of states, which
                followed in the wake of the former shift, actually
                represented an advance in the well-being of the people who 
                underwent those transformations. The conventional narrative,
                which Scott seeks to undermine, holds that these were fairly
                unambiguous advances in the upward progress of civilization.
            </p>

            <p>
                One reason Scott presents that calls the conventional story
                into doubt is the great instability of early states -- if they
                were really such a great advance, why would they have
                collapsed so readily? Besides "extrinsic" causes, such as
                climatic events, Scott cites three "intrinsic" causes of the
                demise of early states: the high incidence of disease caused by
                the unprecedented crowding of human beings and their livestock,
                the huge new demand for lumber that stripped watersheds of a
                barrier to flooding, and intensive irrigation that led to
                salinization of the soil.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another aspect of the conventional narrative the Scott
                questions is the idea that it was only with the agricultural
                revolution that humans began to seriously alter their
                environment. In terms of long-term impact on the environment,
                he notes that the harnessing
                of fire and its use over the last 400,000 years to alter the
                landscape might "overwhelm crop and livestock domestication"
                (p. 38). In fact, Native Americans were such prolifigate users
                of fire that the cessation of the CO<sub>2</sub> output
                from such burning may have caused the Little Ice Age.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scott also dismisses the belief that we can easily categorize people
                into a scale of "advancement" based on whether they were
                "hunter-gatherers, shifting cultivators, pastoralists" or
                settled farmers. Instead, evidence shows that peoples readily
                shifted among these ways of making a living, often combining
                them, or shifting from an "advanced" mode of living to a more
                "primitive" one when they found themselves in a new environment
                in which the "primitive" mode seemed more promising, as did the
                agriculturalists of Taiwan when they moved to the richer
                environment of Southeast Asia, and "reverted" to foraging and
                hunting. (p. 61)
            </p>

            <p>
                In fact, Scott insists, there is no salient point at which
                hunter-gatherers suddenly become farmers. Instead, we have a
                continuum of landscape modifications which humans find to be to
                their advantage. Long before we domesticated grains, we were
                modifying environments so that they would produce more of the
                plants we liked. Deliberately planting a seed or tuber is "only
                one of hundreds of techniques designed to increase the
                productivity, density, and health of desirable but
                morphologically wild plants" (p. 70), including pruning
                undesirable plants, weeding, mulching, pruning, thinning,
                replanting, watering, and fertilizing. The richness of
                pre-agricultural food sources raises the question of why
                fixed-field agriculture with a focus on one or two grain crops
                was ever adopted in the first place, a question that Scott
                admits remains unanswered. The mystery deepens when we
                contemplate the fact that, in the process of domesticating
                cereals and livestock, we were forced, to a great extent, to
                domesticate ourselves as well, devoting an extraordinary degree
                of attention to these increasingly fragile food sources.
            </p>

            <p>
                What's more, the standard view of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle
                as "primitive" compared to that of agriculturalists is belied
                by the fact that the cognitive skills necessary to survive as a
                hunter-gatherer are far more complex and varied than those of
                a farmer, as much as the farmer's are more complex than the
                assembly-line worker: "Each step represents a substantial narrowing
                of focus and a simplification of tasks" (p. 90).
            </p>

            <p>
                Early states, Scott holds, were based upon collecting people in
                a limited area who could produce a surplus of some cereal
                grain, and then collecting that surplus to support the state.
                He outlines why cereal grains are crucial here, and thus there
                were no early tuber-states, or banana states: cereals grow
                above ground, and so are easily surveyed, and they ripen all at
                once, so the tax collector knows when to come around for
                collection. Some degree of coercion was necessary to extract
                the surplus for the needs of the state, but the early states
                faced a delicate balancing act: since there were always
                non-state regions close by, if the extraction became to
                onerous, the state's subjects might flee en masse to one of
                them. States often responded to this threat by erecting
                barriers to flight: the Great Wall of China, Scott notes,
                existed as much to keep state subjects in as to keep
                "barbarians" out. Another measure that early states typically
                employed to fight the loss of subjects was the capturing of
                slaves in war. As Scott puts it: "the early state elaborated
                and scaled up the institution of slavery as an essential
                means to maximize its productive population and the surplus
                it could appropriate. (p. 155)

            <p>
            Scott disputes the usual formulation of the disappearance of early
            states as "collapses." Often, instead, such events meant the escape
            of a subject population from state bondage, and an increase in
            their well-being.  Why, then, the frequent narrative of collapses?
            Scott claims it is largely because archaeologists lose their
            "beloved objects" such as concentrated ruins, written records, and
            luxury goods (pp. 186-187).
            </p>

            Scott closes with a chapter entitled "The
            Golden Age of the Barbarians." In it, he notes how 
            for millennia after the rise of the first states, the vast
            majority of the globe's population lived outside of states. But
            among those non-state peoples, a few took on special status as
            "barbarians": they were at the periphery of a
            state, and their lives and their economies were
            deeply intertwined with those of their state-dwelling counterparts.
            At times, they interacted with their neighbor states simply by
            raiding. But a more stable strategy was to agree, in return
            for agreeing to abjure raiding, that they received "gifts" or trade
            monopolies or payments for "military service." In short, the
            barbarians realized that running a protection racket is a better
            long-run strategy than wiping out the source of revenue. Scott
            notes that "a stable protection racket like this is hard to
            distinguish from the archaic state itself" (p. 141).
            </p>

            <p>
            Scott notes that during the several millennia during which
            barbarians lived on the periphery of states, their lives often
            would have been both healthier and freer than
            their neighbors who lived within states. However, he cites
            "melancholy" aspects of this golden age of barbarians: "By
            systematically replenishing the state's manpower base by slaving
            and by protecting and expanding the state with its military
            services, the barbarians willing dug their own grave" (p. 256).
            </p>

            <p>
                Many of Scott's contentions in this work are speculative, and
                new research may overturn some of the bases for them.
                Nevertheless, this is a landmark work, with which future
                studies on the rise of the state will have to contend.
