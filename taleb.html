        <h1>
            Getting Under Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Skin
        </h1>

        <p>
            Nassim Nicholas Taleb hates being called an "intellectual," so
            let's instead refer to him as a thinker, and go on to note
            that he is one of the most important thinkers of our time.
            That importance comes not so much from the volume of work he has
            produced, as from the fact that, with each new book, he
            gives his readers a significant new lens through which 
            one can look at the world. Furthermore, each book has grown out
            of the previous one, such that something mentioned briefly
            in one book would become the theme of the next one. And
            all of this work has been unified by the theme of 
            how to proceed in life in the face of "the dark forces
            of time and ignorance," informed by a deep knowledge of probability
            and statistics, and gleeful in its skewering of IYIs (intellectual
            yet idiots) who understand just enough about uncertainty to
            massively screw things up.
        </p>

        <p>
            In <i>The Black Swan</i>, his most famous work
            (described as one of "Twelve Books That
            Helped Change the World" in the UK <i>Sunday Times</i>), Taleb
            highlighted how little we really can say about the "tails" of 
            probability distributions that we suppose we can model. The
            book has been credited with foeshadowing the financial crisis of
            2008. The importance of "tail risk" might be understood, in
            the context of that meltdown, as follows: the banks investing 
            in mortgages relied on models that assumed the risk of a
            nation-wide decline in housing prices in the US was 
            minute. But how "minute" is minute? Once in 100 years?
            Once in 1000 years? Once in 10,000 years? The banks chose the 
            "extremely unlikely" end of that spectrum, but they did so based 
            upon... only a few decades of data on the US housing market!
        </p>

        <p>
            "Anti-fragility" was a minor theme in <i>The Black Swan</i>,
            but it became the major one of his next full-length work
            (he released a book of aphorisms in between) <i>Antifragile: Things
            That Gain from Disorder</i>. This work introduced a whole new
            category into our thinking about the impact of randomness on
            entities in the world. Formerly, things were generally thought
            of as being robust -- able to withstand some random shocks --
            or fragile, and easily broken by such shocks. But <i>Antifragile</i>
            insisted on the need for a third category, the eponymous
            antifragile, which contains things that become stronger
            when stressed. The concept caught on slowly at first,
            but is now finding applications in medicine, nutrition, exercise,
            finance, politics, physics, and information technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Antifragile</i> also introduces a story that is probably crucial
            to understanding Taleb's famously cantankerous public personality.
            (Full disclosure: Taleb is my colleague at the NYU Tandon School
            of Engineering, and in person, he is polite and friendly.)
            His great-grandfather was dying, and called his grandfather 
            to his bedside. He let his son know how disappointed he was in the
            fact that no one was badmouthing him: that meant his son was too
            wimpy to be capable of generating envy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taleb has made sure he will never face such criticism himself:
            he takes glee in launching feuds with prominent intellectuals,
            such as Steven Pinker, Mary Beard, Cass Sunstein,
            or Paul Krugman, and, in fact,
            has coined a new term to describe such foes: IYIs, or
            "intellectuals yet idiots." Among the characteristics of IYIs is
            that they go on and on about their concern for the poor, but never
            hang out with those of lower social status; they praise "diversity"
            but have never gotten drunk with a minority cab driver or 
            spent time in a Jamaican nightclub; they are proud of their 
            braininess but have never read Michael Oakeshott or John Gray;
            they are public egalitarians but are obsessively concerned with
            their status in their university or their reviews in <i>The New
            York Times</i>. They place great faith in "statistical" studies
            without understanding anything about the foundations of statistics,
            and they follow the most-recent publicly promulgated dietary 
            guidelines without ever noticing that such guidelines continually
            contradict the previous set of guidelines issued just a year or two
            previously. They pretend to be good "Darwinists" while holding in
            contempt traditions that have survived for thousands of years.

            His new book, <i>Skin in the Game</i> (dedicated to Ron Paul
            and Ralph Nader), extends observations made
            about asymmetrical risk in <i>Antifragile</i> into a thesis about
            how human institutions "learn" over time. In addition, the book 
            analyzes large swaths of ethics as conceerned with unequal
            distributions of "skin in the game."
        </p>

        <p>
            He begins by discussing Antaeus, the mythical son of Mother Earth
            and Poseidon: he was unbeatable in a fight, at least so long as he 
            could kep contact with the ground: his mother! But Hercules was
            able to defeat him by lifting him in the air and crushing him:
            this is a lesson to "keep our feet on the ground," i.e., to keep
            in contact with the practical world, and not fly off into
            an abstract heaven of theorizing disconnected from reality.
        </p>

        <p>
            He immediately extends this trope to modern Libya: the 
            "interventionistas," foreign policy theorists with no "skin
            in the game" -- they suffer no consequences when their advice goes
            disastrously wrong -- who have repeatedly urged us to intervene 
            in foreign countries -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria -- whose
            governments did not meet the interventionistas
            abstract standards for political acceptability. Each of those
            interventions made life for the average person in the country being
            "saved" significantly worse -- and yet the interventionistas pay
            no price whatsoever for wrecking the lives of millions, but
            instead keep appearing on CNN and PBS as "experts" who should
            be guiding the rest of us as to what country we ought to bomb
            next. Taleb contrasts the interventionistas lack of skin in the
            game with rulers in the ancient world, who would often 
            appear at the front in any wars they undertook: he cites the
            Roman emperor Julian the Apostate, who died with a Persian
            spear in his chest.
        </p>

        <p>
            Taleb next describes the "Bob Rubin trade": Robert Rubin, 
            who was Treasury Secretary under the Clintons, returned to
            the "private sector" as director of Citigroup, from whom he
            received $120 million in compensation in the decade before the
            banking crisis of 2008.
        </p>

        <p>
            "The move took place mostly because of the overbureaucratization of
            the system as paper shufflers (who think work is mostly about paper
            shuffling) overburdened the banks with rules -- but somehow, in the
            thousands of pages of additional regulations, <i>they avoided
            considering skin in the game</i>." In other words, rather than
            simply making bankers personally responsible for the meltdowns
            they create, by, for example, fining Bob Rubin $115 million
            for his role in the 2008 financial crisis, the IYIs instead 
            devise a new, bizarrely complex set of financial "regulations,"
            that, they assure us, will mean that "this can never happen
            again," but which will instead simply allow a new Bob Rubin,
            trained at his Ivy League school to master such bureaucratese,
            to game the system anew.
        </p>

        <p>
            Christology is also examined 
            in light of the book's overarching theme, and
            Taleb finds that the Church Fathers were wise: Christ <i>had</i>
            to be fully human, or he wouldn't have had "skin in the game":
            a divine figure just playing at being human, a la Zeus
            or visiting angel, isn't really risking anything.
            And here I would like to note a shortcoming in Taleb's work:
            while he defends traditional religions, he does so based solely 
            on the beneficial <i>practical</i> effects of the beliefs they
            promote. The idea that there might be something transcendental
            at the core of some religion, something worth respecting
            <i>even if</i> the practical effects of doing so might prove
            disastrous, does not seem to be within his cognitive horizon.

        class of people who are better at explaining than understanding" --

        Beliefs aren't rational, only actions are:

        "There is no such thing as the 'rationality' of a belief, there is
        rationality of action." --  p. 220
        </p>

        <p>
        "How much you truly 'believe' in something can be manifested only
        through what you are willing to risk for it." -- p. 223
