                <i>Microservices and Containers</i>
                is an interesting book, albeit a flawed one.
                It addresses two currently important topics,
                but only loosely justifies putting the two
                topics in the same work. It is divided into three sections:
                first addressing microservices, the second containers, and the
                third offers a case study combining the two.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the first part of the book,
                Kocher argues that for organizations with large, monolithic 
                applications, adopting a microservice approach should prove
                beneficial because:
            </p>

            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    They are simpler to understand than a monolithic application.
                </li>

                <li>
                    They are easier to scale: only the part of the overall
                    application that is the bottleneck needs to be 
                    given more resources.
                </li>

                <li>
                    It is easier to do continuous delivery when it is
                    microservices being updated, rather than an entire
                    monolithic application.
                </li>

                <li>
                    There will be looser coupling between components of the system
                    when it is built on microservices.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Bugs are isolated in a microservice and can't bring
                    down all components of a system.
                </li>

                <li>
                    They enable more freedom of choice among technologies,
                    as each microservice team can choose different languages,
                    libraries, databases, and so on.
                </li>


            </ul>

            <p>
                Part two of the book addresses containers, and in particular
                Docker.  Containers are a lightweight method of packing an
                application together with all of the machinery (OS, database,
                files, environment settings, etc.) that support it.  The
                connection between part one of the book and this part is
                tenuous, and consists in little more than Kocher's assertion
                that containers are a good way to run multiple microservices.
                Alternatives, like "serverless" computing in the cloud, are not
                examined. Nevertheless, these chapters do provide a good
                overview of container use, why you might prefer them to
                virtuals machines (they use resources more efficiently), and
                why Docker is the most popular container implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of the container section, the author includes two
                chapters on "Container Orchestration" and 
                "Containers Management." These are summaries of the 
                technical solutions available for deploying a suite of
                containers, each of which needs to be able to talk to all of
                the other containers, and for seeing how all of those
                containers are doing. 
                There are brief but serviceable sections on Mesos, Kubernetes,
                and Docker Swarm, all of which manage suites of containers.
                There is also a section on the important topic 
                of service discovery: with multiple containers spinning up
                and coming down all over your network of hundreds or 
                thousands of microservices, how is a poor client machine
                supposed to know where to connect to what? The best solution,
                per Kocher, is to keep the knowledge in something like a
                load balancer, which fields requests for, say, user
                authentication, and knows where all the authentication servers
                are and which are busy, so it can route the client request to
                the best one.
            </p>

            <p>
                The chapters illustrating how to use containers and
                microservices to build a helpdesk app provide useful examples 
                of how to apply the more theoretical material from the first
                two sections. The conclusion of the book suddenly introduces 
                the term <i>DevOps</i>, "another hot topic" (247). The topic is
                dealt with so briefly one can't help but suspect it was thrown
                in since it <i>is</i> a hot topic: if DevOps was going to be
                addressed in the book, it would have been much better to 
                keep the topic in mind throughout, and discuss how
                microservices and containers enable DevOps practices
                as appropriate in each section.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some contentions in the book don't seem
                to make sense. For instance, the author writes, "Docker...
                addresses the deployment and scalability problems by separating
                applications from the info structure dependencies. It addresses
                these problems with containers, which allow us to package the
                application with all its dependencies" (49). So Docker "separates"
                applications and their infrastructure dependencies by...
                packaging them together?
            </p>

            <p>
                Another frustrating aspect of this book is the use of extensive
                screen dumps to pad out the material. For instance, the chapter
                on Docker commands is about 50% images of the output
                of such commands. A little of this sort of things is OK, but a
                little goes a long way, and the extensive use of these images
                here has gone way too far.
            </p>

            <p>
                In summary, if one is unfamiliar with microservices and/or
                containers, this book provides a decent introduction to 
                both topics. That being the case, with some better editing, 
                a more robust link established between the two topics,
                and discussion of DevOps integrated throughout,
                this book could have gone from being a decent introduction to
                an excellent one.
