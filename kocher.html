                The connection between part one of the book, and part two,
                dealing with containers, and in particular Docker, is loose,
                and consists in little more than Kocher's assertion that 
                containers are a good way to run multiple microservices.
                Alternatives, like "serverless" computing in the cloud,
                are not examined.

                The editors of this book let the author down in many places,
                leaving in such clunkers as "becomes little complex" and "What
                would happen if the service... has error?"
                A more serious problem is that several contentions don't seem
                to make sense. For instance, the author writes, "Docker...
                addresses the deployment and scalability problems by separating
                applications from the info structure dependencies. It addresses
                these problems with containers, which allow us to package the
                application with all its dependencies." So Docker "separates"
                applications and their infrastructure dependencies by...
                packaging them together?
