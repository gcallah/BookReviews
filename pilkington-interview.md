# Pilkington Interview



Do we really know liberalism is collapsing? The Roman polity collapsed over a period of about 1500 years, from the time
of the Gracchi brothers until the fall of Constantinople.

How do we know that liberalism won't collapse as slowly as that?


How do we integrate religion given what our society is like?


Not judging pro-family policies based on short-term effects: how do we get feedback then?



Is keeping a society civilized the main aim of religions?



"When a religion undergoes a process of liberalization, what is really taking place is the dissolution of that religion in the acid bath of liberal ideology." 203


The key assumption is that if some country's labor receives half the wage, that it is also only half as productive.

Do we really have to worry about persistent trade deficits?
What about my trade deficit with the neighborhood grocer?


The future is mysterious

The US should recognize it's an empire, and that empires are not always bad things. Someone could refer to Monty
Python's amusing skit "what have the Romans ever done for us?" or cite the fact that when the western Roman Empire
collapsed, populations that have been living in the fertile river valleys moved back up to fortified hilltop towns.




Liberalism:
Unless the Lord guards the city, those that guard guard in vain

CS Lewis: Tao

Voegelin: transcendent ground


Trump?


All my libertarian friends would immediately recognize the problem with comparing military spending and consumer
spending. So is this really a case where liberal ideology leads people astray? 


"The technologies themselves were developed by the state..."


Toyota, 3M, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC

"Think how much more the private sector might've developed if all those resources weren't diverted to government use?"


Sexual consumerism

Stupid idea: "sex is a purely private affair"

Raising awareness of STDs: word magic!

Why "rate of people" instead of birth rate?


What about the 24 hour clock? 

If they try to dictate that the day should be 50 of our current hours, because it is more rational, and have people work
25 and sleep 25, certainly that would clash with reality. But why does dividing the actual day into 10 hours clash with
it?

"social organism automatically adjusts"

Is that really the right way to describe what is going on?


People with no first-cousins or siblings!
