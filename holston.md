In recent years, there has been, amongst academic political theorists, a great amount of attention devoted to justifying
political actions based on theories of "public reason" or "deliberative democracy." The impetus for this focus has been
the realization that defending democratic decisions simply upon a "most people agreed to this, therefore it is OK"
basis is clearly flawed: simply because most people in some polity agree that redheads are bad and should be eliminated
does not render a law to execute all of them just.

To roughly characterize the "deliberative" turn, these theorists have argued that a law or policy is only valid if it
can be "reasonably" defended to all those who will be subject to its dictates. But this approach faces the problem of
exactly what objections to a policy should be regarded as "reasonable": for instance, is a devout Muslim "unreasonable"
in objecting to a law that permits non-halal slaughter of animals?

Holston's approach to studying the social world (following that of his mentor, Claes Ryn) is interesting and important
in that it occupies a middle ground between two extremes: On the one hand, many of the followers of Leo Strauss hold
that any "historicism," such as taking into account historical circumstances when considering how some polity ought to
be governed, simply leads to surrendering virtue to the seductive song of moral relativism. On the other hand, there are
historicists, such as Oswald Spengler or Richard Rorty,
for whom historicism does indeed imply moral relativism. But Holston, like Ryn,
argues that, while transcendent moral truths exist, we only can move towards realizing them through concrete historical
mores, practices, and cultures.

Holston declares that his approach is historical in two senses, firstly, "it views this discussion regarding deliberation
itself as taking place over time" (2). Secondly, his approach is historical "in the sense that it aims to bring to
bear on this conversation a sensitivity to the historical nature of deliberation in any society" (3).

Holston argues that Rousseau set himself in opposition to the materialism of Thomas Hobbes, and in particular, "the
sanction of the political doctrine that might makes right." (19)

Did Hobbes really hold that "might makes right"?  That seems a rather crude interpretation of what he was up to. Of
course the sovereign possesses might, but that is not what makes it right to obey him: it is rather that this might
enables him to call a truce in the war of all against all. If he used his might to, for instance, wipe out his own
subjects, Hobbes would certainly not claim that that makes it right.



"where the ancients had once seen the laws formalism is simultaneously an advantage, and a disadvantage in the
resolution of moral and political questions, Kant saw only the formerâ€¦" 57

Holston writes "Over the course of the last several decades, the autonomy tradition of Rousseau and Kant has enjoyed
somewhat of a renaissance in contemporary democratic theory" (63)

This has been due to dissatisfaction with the previously ascendant view that the virtue of democracy lies in its
promoting the individual preferences of as many people as possible, since this may permit a majority to run roughshod
over the rights of a minority. Holston cites Jurgen Habermas, from the continental philosophical tradition, and John
Rawls, from the analytic tradition, as being the two key founders of this renaissance. 


Essentially, Rawls is taking a decision procedure that might once have worked in a faculty meeting at Harvard, and
suggesting it could also work in a society of over a quarter of a billion people. 


Holston is neither a dogmatist nor a nostalgic reactionary. He fully recognizes that the conditions faced by a
continent-spanning, multi-ethnic republic, like the United States, are very different from those
of a Greek polis, or a medieval kingdom. That the United States could be well governed
simply by importing the political practice of such polities. But he does argue, and successfully, in my view,
that The balance in modern politics has tilted entirely too far toward the cosmopolitan and the universal,
and has ignored the local and particular. The result is that our politics is directed largely by a global elite that
lays claim to having a properly cosmopolitan and universal point of view, leaving the average citizen voiceless.

It is only at a local level that true political deliberation among citizens can take place. Holston's central message is
that, if deliberative democrats are serious about their enterprise, they ought to be working to devolve decision making
to the local level as far as possible.
