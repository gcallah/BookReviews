# Pilkington Interview



## Collapse

Do we really know liberalism is immediately collapsing? The Roman polity collapsed over a period of about 1500 years, from the time
of the Gracchi brothers until the fall of Constantinople.

How do we know that liberalism won't collapse as slowly as that?

Stable societies are integralist or empires.

The US should recognize it's an empire, and that empires are not always bad things. Someone could refer to Monty
Python's amusing skit "what have the Romans ever done for us?" or cite the fact that when the western Roman Empire
collapsed, populations that have been living in the fertile river valleys moved back up to fortified hilltop towns.



## Good Society

Is it really true that every society that "organizes itself in line with human nature... Will be stable, prosperous, and
its inhabitants will be content and happy"?

Alternate: Just your best shot at getting through this vale of tears relatively unscathed?

The fall: Eden

Augustine: City of God in response to the sack of Rome in 410. Pagans blamed Christianity.

Plato: in the Republic, Plato argues that even if the perfect polity (the kallipolis, or ideal city-state) could be
created, it would inevitably decay. This is because it would exist in the material, "sensible" world of "coming-to-be
and passing-away," where change and decay are inescapable


Powerful neighbors: Poland in 1939.


## John Gray and Post-Liberalism

He says it is just not practical, given the diversity in western countries, to imagine any kind of integralism in the
near future. He says a modus vivendi is the best we can do.


How do we integrate religion given what our society is like?


## Comparative Advantage and Trade

I don't think Ricardo's law assumes wage rates are the same between different countries.

Do we really have to worry about persistent trade deficits?
What about my trade deficit with the neighborhood grocer?

## Military

The first time that I've seen the case that global liberalism is not only militarily mistaken in undertaking supposedly
liberalizing wars, but that liberalism leads to mistakes about *tactics*.

Military spending:

All my libertarian friends would immediately recognize the problem with comparing military spending and consumer
spending. So is this really a case where liberal ideology leads people astray? 


"The technologies themselves were developed by the state..."


Toyota, 3M, Bell Labs, Xerox PARC

"Think how much more the private sector might've developed if all those resources weren't diverted to government use?"


## Policy:

Not judging pro-family policies based on short-term effects: how do we get feedback then?

Is dictating a formula for trade deficits really the answer? Are these forced investments likely to be successful?
Might they not just duplicate the disasters of the neo-liberal "help" to Third World countries?


## Rationalism

What about the 24-hour clock? 

If they try to dictate that the day should be 50 of our current hours, because it is more rational, and have people work
25 and sleep 25, certainly that would clash with reality. But why does dividing the actual day into 10 hours clash with
it?

24 even hours the outcome of the spread of mechanical clocks.


## Sex


Stupid idea: "sex is a purely private affair"

Raising awareness of STDs: word magic!

Why "rate of people" instead of birth rate?

People with no first-cousins or siblings!
