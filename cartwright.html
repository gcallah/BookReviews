            <p>
                This volume is a collection of essays broadly inspired by the 
                philosophy of science of Nancy Cartwright, the thinker who
                perhaps more than any other modern practitioner has turned the
                discipline towards a realist notion of causation, and an
                empirical appreciation for how scientists actually achieve the
                results they do, and away from the scientistic theories
                behind such ventures as the "unity of science" project.

                Cartwright casually mentions the idea that singular
                causation is actually the fundament, but dismisses it
                in favor of a "general to specific" (19) approach.
                <br />
                Cartwright defends the notion of causation in singular cases
                against those who contend that only a statistical study on a
                large sample can produce robust evidence of causation. She
                holds that we can detect single causes much as we detect causes
                in a large study, as exhibitions of law-like regularities.

                Ot&aacute;vio Bueno and Robin Neiman address the vexed
                issue of when, if ever, clinical trials should be halted
                "early" because of accumulating evidence that the treatment 
                being tested is either causing such harm that it should no 
                longer be continued for the treatment group, or producing
                such benefits that denying it to the control group is
                unethical. But their effort suffers from vagueness
                and tautology: they complain, for instance, that stopping the
                trial early only constitutes "partial evidence" for the
                hypothesis being tested, as though any full trial could
                ever provide "full evidence." They worry that in such
                circumstances "the emerging pattern in the data may turn out to be 
                misleading: additional data could overthrow that pattern" (41).
                But obviously this worry also applies to "full" trials!
                They present such vacuous truisms as "one will eventually
                get full evidence [for a hypothesis, or] otherwise one
                won't" as though they could provide any meaningful
                guide to real researchers as to what they should do when
                facing a tricky ethical decision. They claim that after a
                partial trial, "additional information needs to be
                gathered before any epistemic decision is made" (41)not noticing
                that "additional information needs to be gathered" <i>is</i>
                an "epistemic decision." They
                contend that evidence does not and should not
                depend on the beliefs of the person evaluating the evidence.
                One would have thought that Michael Polanyi's work would have
                put an end to such silliness long ago: evidence is always
                evidence <i>to</i> someone, and whether it counts as evidence
                will depend upon their beliefs.

                In what is the most frustrating paper in the book, 
                Michael Strevens defines 'fundamentalism' as
                the notion that "Everything is
                made up of a single kind of stuff and everything
                that happens is directed
                solely by fundamental laws of physics that,
                depending on the configuration of
                stuff at one moment, determine its
                configuration at the next" (69). He goes on
                to claim that fundamentalism implies that
                all sciences really should just
                operate by showing how, say, mate selection
                in bower birds, or the nature of
                parliamentary institutions in Medieval Europe,
                can be derived from the laws of
                physics alone. The program to make all
                sciences a branch of physics goes under
                the name "unity of science."
            </p>

            <p>
                Strevens backs his fundamentalist faith
                with the claim that "the empirical
                evidence for fundamentalism has accumulated
                swiftly" (69). But he presents no
                such evidence, for, truth be told,
                there is none: instead, as he admits, "Real
                science is not only largely disunified;
                it is largely content to be disunified"
                (71). He readily confesses that Nancy Cartwright
                has shown that not only are
                all other sciences not being reduced to physics,
                but even within physics, a
                plethora of sub-studies are not being
                reduced to "fundamental" physics. But
                like a good Biblical fundamentalist arguing
                away the dating of dinosaur bones,
                Strevens argues that this massive evidence
                against fundamentalism is actually
                just what we should expect if fundamentalism is true.

            Roman Frigg and James Nguyen tackle the issue of how scientific models
            "represent" the phenomenon they are said to be modeling. Their
            ingenious answer is that a scientific model points to a class of
            events by declaration ("this is a model of the economy") but that
            it is successful as a scientific model to the extent it exemplifies
            and draws our attention to particular aspects of the thing modeled.
            Thus, our model of the economy built from
            pipes and water is a <i>good</i>
            model if, say, the flow of cash through the real economy is
            exemplified by the flow of water through the pipes.
            They do make the curious assertion that things like pictures
            of griffins or maps of Middle Earth do not represent anything:
            surely these are visible representation of things human beings have
            imagined!

                Space does not permit a more thorough examination of the many
                interesting papers in this volume (of particular note among
                the neglected is Julian Reiss's excellent paper on causality),
                but for anyone interested 
                in the impact of Cartwright's work on the philosophy and
                the practice of science, this is an essential reference.
