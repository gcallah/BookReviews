            McWhorter commits a serious error in assigning the cause of this
            multitude of bewildering variety in human language. He writes, "In
            fact, there is a coherent explanation... That explanation is, quite
            simply, chance" (43). This is nonsense, albeit common nonsense.
            "Chance" is not an explanation for anything: chance is the word we
            use for happenings we <i>can't</i> explain. In cases such as
            the presence of evidential markers in the Tuyuca language,
            McWhorter is fighting against the Whorfian view that there is
            always a <i>macro-level</i>, cultural/environmental explanation
            for the features of a language. And he makes a strong case,
            throughout the book, that that is not so.

            But there is
            certainly <i>some</i> explanation for how they arose: perhaps a
            long-lived chief was an especially suspicious fellow, and some
            little tic led him to put small sounds of doubt at the end of
            otherwise factual statements when he questioned their factualness.
            Now, this would be a fact of history that is long lost, and that we
            probably have no hope of ever recovering. And to that extent, 
            McWhorter would be accurate if he had said, "It might as well have
            been the flip of a coin." But, of course, coin flips are not chance 
            events! Or, rather, saying they are a chance event is an expression
            of our ignorance of, and, indeed, despair at ever detecting, what
            really caused a coin to come up heads or tails on some particular
            flip.

            <p>
            Consider the opening toss before a football game, which determines
            who kicks off. These events are governed by "chance" from the point 
            of view of the players and referees involved. But whether the coin
            comes up heads or tails is, in fact, determined by the force and
            angle of the refs flip, the air resistance, the gusts of wind that
            impact it, the participants' movements, and more. If anyone
            involved could exactly determine the impact of all of those
            factors and could rapidly calculate with them, he could say for
            sure whether the coin would land on heads or tails. It is their
            inability to do such calculations that makes the coin flip, from
            their point of view, chance, and a fair way to decide who kicks
            off. But it is certainly not an explanation for why the coin landed
            as it did: it is the admission that the participants <i>can't</i>
            explain it.

            McWhorter goes on to, about what he see as the chance nature of
            these languages changes, "There is a comfort in this reality" (43).
            Well, as Rocky Rococo would say, "Maybe yes, maybe no." But in
            either case, so what? Are we now weighting the degree of comfort
            scientific theories provide in our evaluations of them? Should we
            give a couple of points to Ptolemy vis-a-vis Copernicus of people 
            are more comfortable with a stationary earth? He brings similar,
            one would think irrelevant, considerations into play a bit later,
            when he writes, "Whorfianism, here, seems dangerous" (78) (in
            making the Chinese speakers seem less clear-headed than English
            ones). But if Whorfianism is <i>true</i>, than even if it is
            "dangerous" in the way McWhorter suggests, well...? What? We should
            surpress it? I thought scientists were proud iconclasts, who
            followed their theories however many idols were crushed along the
            way?

            IQ: "Respondendents tended to find the very idea of answering
            questions disconnected from real-world utility idle, boring,
            and even faintly ridiculous" (83).
